Passage: Its 25 drops per ml, you guys are all wrong. If it is water, the standard was changed 15 - 20 years ago to make 20 drops = 1mL. The viscosity of most things is temperature dependent, so this would be at room temperature. Hope this helps.
Query: how many eye drops per ml
Does the passage answer the query?
Answer: Yes

Passage: RE: How many eyedrops are there in a 10 ml bottle of Cosopt? My Kaiser pharmacy insists that 2 bottles should last me 100 days but I run out way before that time when I am using 4 drops per day.In the past other pharmacies have given me 3 10-ml bottles for 100 days.E: How many eyedrops are there in a 10 ml bottle of Cosopt?

A "Hello, World!" program is often the first written by a student of a new programming language,[1] but such a program can also be used as a sanity check to ensure that the computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands how to use it.'''

Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[31] Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[32][33] Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[34] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions.'''
