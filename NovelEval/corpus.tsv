0-0	Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a 2023 American computer-animated superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Miles Morales / Spider-Man, produced by Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation in association with Marvel Entertainment, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. The sequel to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), it is set in a shared multiverse of alternate universes called the Spider-Verse. The film is directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson (in Dos Santos and Thompson's feature directorial debuts), from a screenplay written by Phil Lord, Christopher Miller (who both also produce) and David Callaham. Shameik Moore voices Miles, starring alongside Hailee Steinfeld, Brian Tyree Henry, Luna Lauren Vélez, Jake Johnson, Jason Schwartzman, Issa Rae, Karan Soni, Daniel Kaluuya, and Oscar Isaac. In the film, Miles goes on an adventure with Gwen Stacy / Spider-Woman across the multiverse where he meets a new team of Spider-People known as the Spider-Society, led by Miguel O' Hara / Spider-Man 2099, but comes into conflict with them over handling a new threat.
0-1	Sony began developing a sequel to Into the Spider-Verse before its 2018 release, with the writing and directing team attached. It was set to focus on the relationship between Moore's Miles and Steinfeld's Gwen. The sequel was officially announced in November 2019 and animation work began in June 2020, with a different visual style for each of the six universes visited by the characters. With a runtime of 140 minutes, it is the longest animated film ever produced by an American studio.[
0-2	Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse premiered at the Regency Village Theatre in Los Angeles, California on May 30, 2023, and was released in the United States on June 2, having been delayed from an original April 2022 date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Like its predecessor, the film received acclaim from critics, and was a box office success, grossing over $494 million against a production budget of $100 million at the worldwide box office, surpassing its predecessor and becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2023. A third film, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, is scheduled to be released on March 29, 2024, while a female-focused spin-off film, Spider-Woman, is in development.
0-3	Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse arrived in theaters five years ago and introduced the world to a few Spider people from throughout the Spider-Verse. The sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, hit theaters this week and will expand that multiverse in some massive ways. Not only will we finally see more of the Spider-Verse, but we will also seen hundreds of different Spider people. That's right, there will be hundreds of different Spider-Man characters present in the movie. Justin Thompson directed Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse alongside Kemp Powers and Joaquin Dos Santos, and Thompson claims there are around 280 different variations of Spider-characters throughout the film. About 100 of them have names, while the rest exist in the background.
0-4	"""The exact number? Oh boy, we kept adding, like all the way up until the very end,"" Thompson told Collider in a recent interview. ""Honestly, I'm gonna be level with you, we just finished the film, like in the last like two weeks, and I don't think I've had time to pause and actually take a final count. But I think it was about 280 the last time I looked in. Just to be clear, that doesn't mean specific, unique characters that you might recognize, it might mean variations as well. But if you're just talking about named characters, then I think there's probably about 95."""
0-5	"By the end of November 2018, ahead of the release of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) the following month, Sony Pictures Animation had begun developing a sequel[43] due to the ""incredible buzz"" surrounding the project.[44] The sequel was to continue the story of Shameik Moore's Miles Morales / Spider-Man,[6][7] working from ""seeds [that were] planted"" throughout the first film.[43] Joaquim Dos Santos and David Callaham were set to direct and write, respectively, with Amy Pascal returning from the first film as producer. The other producers of the first film—Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, Avi Arad, and Christina Steinberg—were all also expected to return in some capacities.[43] The next month, Pascal revealed that the film would focus on Miles and Hailee Steinfeld's Gwen Stacy / Spider-Woman, exploring a romance between the characters that was cut from the first film, and that the sequel would be a ""launching pad"" for a previously announced female-focused spin-off film starring Steinfeld.[7] Sony officially confirmed the sequel in November 2019, with a release date of April 8, 2022, with Lord and Miller returning as producers.[45] In April 2020, Sony shifted the film's release to October 7, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[46]"
0-6	Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse featured 280 different Spider-People. 95 of them were uniquely named and had lines. But there are even more who didn’t speak that showed up as easter eggs from niche comic book moments or were added just for a good laugh. Across the Spider-Verse has different versions of Spider-Man from video games and across Marvel’s many realities. Across the Spider-Verse includes tons of different Spider-Women, featuring Jessica Drew and her awesome motorcycle. Spider-People may not even be accurate since many of these heroes aren’t even people! The 1000 crew members working on this movie truly populated the Spider-Verse with every Spider-Man variant they could think of.
0-7	After spending way too long apart, audiences finally reunited with Miles Morales and the rest of the Spidey gang. Last weekend Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse hit theaters and blew us away. If you haven’t seen the movie yet, stop reading now to avoid spoilers and come back after you leave the theater. If you saw it, maybe read this and go see the movie again. Every frame is an artistic masterpiece and deserves to be seen multiple times. One highlight of the film is the sheer amount of Spider-people we get to see. The Spider Society headquarters has an abundance of Spider-Man variants from various dimensions and realities. Each Spider-person has a unique origin story, costume, and personality. Although lots of them are variations on Peter Parker, there are plenty of other folks in the mix. Let’s go over all the Spider-Men spotted in Across the Spider-Verse.
0-8	Why are there so many Spider-Mans? First things first, why do we have so many Spidey people? As explained by Miguel O’Hara/Spider-Man 2099, our reality is like a giant web. Each web connects to other webs via a fine line. Although each dimension/reality is slightly different, there are still a lot of similarities. For example, each universe (pretty much) has a Spider-Man of some kind. They keep the peace in their world and help maintain the canon of their reality. If someone disrupts the canon too much, that dimension may cease to exist. So each version of Earth gets a number to keep everything in order.
0-9	All the Spider-Man variants in Across the Spider-Verse Shameik Moore as Miles Morales in a suit in Spider-Man Into The Spiderverse (Sony Pictures Animation) Miles Morales/Spider-Man—Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) is the second Spider-Man of Earth-1610, along with their version of Peter Parker. Miles is an anomaly because a spider from Earth-42 bit him, so his Spidey powers don’t come from his reality. He’s adorable and we all love him. Gwen and Peter and Jess in Spider-Verse (Sony Pictures Animation) Gwen Stacy/Spider-Woman—Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) of Earth-65 became the Spidey person of her world. Unlike most Gwens who fall for Peter Parker and end up dead, this Gwen kicks butt and plays the drums. Peter B. Parker/Spider-Man—Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson) is the older and wiser Spidey. He’s basically Spider-Man from Earth-616 (otherwise known as the main Marvel comics universe). Mayday Parker hanging upside down in 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' (Sony Pictures Animation) Mayday Parker/Spider-Girl—As a toddler, Mayday “May” Parker is already joining her dad, Peter B. Parker at the Spider Society. She’s got her own web shooters and a cute crocheted Spider hat. Jessica Drew, a.k.a. Spider-Woman, voiced by Issa Rae in 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' (Sony Pictures Animation) Jess Drew/Spider-Woman—Jess Drew (Issa Rae) is a pregnant motorcycle-riding superhero from Earth-404. We need more of her.
0-10	Supporting Spider-People Spider-Punk in Across the Spider-VerseSony Pictures Some of the rarer Spider-People still had fairly significant roles. We’re speaking, of course, about Pavitr Prabhakar. From Earth-50101, Pavitr comes from a punny version of Manhattan called Mumbattan – a play on Mumbai. He originally appeared in issue one of Spider-Man: India, where he moved to the city with his Aunt Maya and Uncle Bhim after receiving a partial scholarship. He is more or less the same as the Peter Parker from Earth-616 (Marvel’s main canon), although in Across the Spider-Verse, he uses a diabolo, or devil’s yoyo, as a weapon and has amazing hair. Another fun fact – he’s voiced by Karan Soni, who plays Dopinder, Deadpool’s chauffeur in both Deadpool movies.
0-11	Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse eased us into the multiversal weirdness. After introducing Miles, we finally met Peter B. Parker, followed by Spider-Gwen. Soon, things went nuts with a noirish detective Spider-Man, an anime girl from the future, and a cartoon pig. Once all that was done, we got to see a futuristic Spider-Man 2099 interact with a badly animated version with an obsession with pointing. But this year’s Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse goes absolutely crazy with Spider-Man variants. Some are throwaway designs for the movie, but there are also many who are deep cuts from Marvel Comics history. Here’s a guide to all the new arachnid heroes and heroines in Across the Spider-Verse:
0-12	Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse will be in theaters beginning June 2. If you're wondering how and where you can watch it yourself, take a look at the information below. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse marks the return of teen Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) and his multidimensional universe full of Spider-people. The sequel’s predecessor is a visually groundbreaking masterpiece that changed the landscape of animation, and Across the Spider-Verse promises to showcase more of this creativity. The unique animation of the Spider-Verse films has heavily influenced the artistic style of many other films, both released and upcoming. As a result, modern animation is becoming more vibrant and fresh in execution. Academy Award winner Daniel Kaluuya provides insights into his character romance speculation in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. If you loved the animation of 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,’ be sure to watch these incredible animated movies!
0-13	"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a 2018 American computer-animated superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Miles Morales / Spider-Man, produced by Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation in association with Marvel Entertainment. Distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is the first animated film in the Spider-Man franchise.[4][5] Directed by Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman (in Persichetti and Rothman's feature directorial debuts) from a screenplay by Phil Lord and Rothman, it stars Shameik Moore as Morales, alongside the voices of Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld, Mahershala Ali, Brian Tyree Henry, Lily Tomlin, Luna Lauren Vélez, Zoë Kravitz, John Mulaney, Kimiko Glenn, Nicolas Cage, and Liev Schreiber. Inspired by the Amazing Spider-Man story arc ""Spider-Verse"", while also taking inspiration from the Ultimate Marvel comics ""The Death of Spider-Man"" and Spider-Men that served as Miles Morales' debut, the film's story follows Miles as he becomes the new Spider-Man and joins other Spider-People from various parallel universes to save his universe from Kingpin."
0-14	There have been many Spider-Men since the character was introduced in the comics in 1962. First, there were the TV shows. Then came Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man in 2002, before Andrew Garfield assumed the role in 2012. In 2016, Tom Holland’s Spider-Man was introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a slate of three movies (in addition to appearances in other MCU films), the last of which saw all of the modern Spider-Men meet up for the first time with the villains they’ve faced off against. In 2018, Miles Morales made his big-screen debut in the animated hit Into The Spider-Verse, which reveals that all of the Spider-People are connected through the Spider-Verse. Into The Spider-Verse introduced a whole team of Spider-People, including Spider-Man (Jake Johnson), Spider-Ham (John Mulaney), Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn), and Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage). Their coexistence is explained by a multiverse with many dimensions. In the latest Miles-led film, Across The Spider-Verse, audiences get a greater understanding of the vastness of the multiverse. The number of Spider-People can get a little unwieldy, so here’s a primer on who each of the key webslingers are and who they were in the comic books before making their movie debuts.
0-15	The highly-acclaimed global hit animated film Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse has been pulled from the release schedule in UAE, Saudi Arabia and across the Middle East, and will no longer have a theatrical run in the region. The film, a sequel to the 2018 film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse which introduced Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) as a new Spider-Man who teams up with alternate universe versions of the character, was scheduled to debut on June 22 across the territory ahead of the the upcoming Eid Al Adha holiday. I have confirmed with sources that the film did not pass censorship requirements in the UAE and will not see release across the region.
0-16	Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse released its trailer this week. And in it, we got to see all kinds of Spider-People from around the Spider-Verse. There were so many in fact, it’s probably impossible to identify them all. But there are a few Spider-Men and Spider-Women that we know about for sure, as well as some other, more obscure Spider-Men that are going to make an appearance. Across the Spider-Verse has had directors leak appearances and hint at cameos since people first started getting excited about the film. In this sequel, there will be hundreds of Spider-People. The trailer showed a bunch of them in all of their gloriously different animation styles. Though most of them won’t have speaking parts, a lot of them will be featured with at least a small cameo. The directors are even putting in some fun Spider-Memes.
0-17	If you think the world already has enough Spider-Men, you might not be ready for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Part coming-of-age tale, part psychedelic acid trip, and all a love letter to the comic book medium, Sony's animated Marvel movie—written by Phil Lord and directed by Bob Persichetti, Rodney Rothman, and Peter Ramsey—follows Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), a Brooklynite on the cusp of a bite from the same radioactive arachnid that turned Peter Parker into Spider-Man. As Miles still juggles newfound powers with the trials of being an awkward teen, Wilson Fisk (Liev Schrieber) rips a hole in reality, opening the door for the arrival of alt-universe Spideys like Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld), Spider-Man: Noir (Nicolas Cage), Spider-Ham (John Mulaney), Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn), and Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson), a schlubby, out-of-shape version of Spider-Man who couldn't handle that great responsibility that comes with all that great power. This movie is a joy, man, and I can't recommend it enough to anyone who has ever picked a webhead comic off the funny book rack.
0-18	Across the Spider-Verse’s new trailer finds Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) doing just fine in his home universe as he balances life between doing fine in school and dealing with friendly neighborhood villains like the Spot (Jason Schwartzman). As always, all Miles’ mother Rio (Luna Lauren Vélez) and father Jefferson (Brian Tyree Henry) want is for their son to be happy and open up to them. But rather than telling his parents about his double life, whatever Miles is dealing with brings him face to face with his good friend Gwen (Hailee Steinfeld) from another dimension, and this time around she shows up with an invitation to take Miles on an adventure.
0-19	`“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” has become a smash hit at the box office – raking in more than $120 million during its opening weekend, the second largest of the year. Fans and critics alike are praising the sequel to 2018’s “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” for its buffet of visual indulgences, solidifying the franchise’s place in animated movie royalty. And there’s one thing some fans are particularly excited about: Gwen Stacy – a Spider superhero in an alternative universe – might be transgender. Since the movie’s release earlier this month, fans have seized on some hints throughout the movie that seem to be pointing to Gwen’s gender identity. In one scene, a transgender flag is hanging in Gwen’s room, printed with the words “Protect Trans Kids.” In another, Gwen’s father is briefly seen with a trans flag pinned to his police uniform. And throughout, Gwen is draped in pink and blue, the colors of the trans flag.
1-0	What does Apple say about Vision Pro displays? The extremely high-resolution displays are one of the many features that set Vision Pro apart from its competitors. Here’s what Apple has to say about the twin displays (one for each eye): Featuring a breakthrough ultra-high-resolution display system built on top of an Apple silicon chip, Vision Pro uses micro-OLED technology to pack 23 million pixels into two displays, each the size of a postage stamp, with wide color and high dynamic range. This technological breakthrough, combined with custom catadioptric lenses that enable incredible sharpness and clarity, delivers jaw-dropping experiences […] [It] fits 64 pixels in the space of a single iPhone pixel. They’re just seven and a half microns wide, [providing] more pixels than a 4K TV for each eye […] It enables video to be rendered at true 4K resolution with wide color and high dynamic range, all at massive scale. And fine text looks super sharp from any angle.
1-1	The Vision Pro display resolution is one of the many benefits of the device over its rivals, and we yesterday explained the technology that makes it possible – and how it differs from AR/VR headset displays used by other companies. We didn’t know at the time that they would be used in Apple’s spatial computer, but Sony actually showed off the displays a full year ago – and it turns out I was being a little unfair to the Cupertino company… I pointed to the fact that Apple is using a rather confusing term for the display tech. The company refers to it as “micro-OLED,” which has led some to mistake it for microLED. I said it would be better to use the correct term, which is OLED on Silicon, aka OLEDoS.
1-2	"Apple Vision Pro is an upcoming mixed reality headset developed by Apple Inc. It was announced on June 5, 2023, at its 2023 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) and is set to be available for purchase in early 2024 in the United States. It is Apple's first major product since the Apple Watch, released in 2015.[3] Apple has described the Vision Pro as a ""spatial computer,"" where digital media is integrated with the real world and physical inputs, such as motion gestures, eye tracking, and voice input, can be used to interact with the system. The headset is a standalone device that runs visionOS, a derivative of iOS designed for extended reality software."
1-3	Hardware Apple Vision Pro has a laminated glass display front, an aluminum frame covered by a flexible cushion, and an adjustable headband. The frame contains five sensors, six microphones and 12 cameras. Two micro-OLED displays with a total of 23 megapixels, each with a size of a postage stamp, will be seen by the user through the lens. The eyes are tracked by a system of LEDs and infrared cameras, which form the basis of the device's iris scanner named Optic ID (used for authentication, like the iPhone's Face ID). Custom optical inserts are supported for users with prescription glasses; these lenses will attach magnetically to the main lens and are developed in partnership with Carl Zeiss AG. The device's speaker is inside the headband and is placed directly over the user's ears. It can also virtualize surround sound.[2][23] The Vision Pro uses the Apple M2 system on a chip. It is accompanied by a co-processor known as Apple R1, which is used for real-time sensor input processing. The device can be powered by an external power supply, a USB-C port on a Mac, or a battery pack rated for two hours of use.[24][25][26]
1-4	"Software Apple Vision Pro runs visionOS, which is derived primarily from iOS core frameworks, and XR-specific frameworks for foveated rendering and real-time interaction.[29][30] The operating system uses a 3D user interface navigated via finger tracking, eye tracking, and speech recognition. For example, the user can click an element by looking at it and pinching two fingers together, move the element by moving their pinched fingers, and scroll by flicking their wrist. Apps are displayed in floating windows that can be arranged in 3D space. visionOS supports a virtual keyboard for text input, the Siri virtual assistant, and external Bluetooth peripherals including Magic Keyboard, Magic Trackpad, and gamepads.[25][31] Calls can be presented using participants' ""personas"", or individual windows with their video feeds.[28]"
1-5	"Pre-release and unveiling Samuel Axon of Ars Technica felt that the Vision Pro was ""truly something I had never seen before"", noting the intuitiveness of its user interface in a choreographed demo given by Apple, and praising a dinosaur tech demo for its immersiveness. Axon felt that its displays were dim but ""much better than other headsets I've used on this front, even if it still wasn’t perfect"", and that the personas looked ""surreal"" but conveyed body language better than a more stylized avatar (such as Animoji or Horizon Worlds).[28] He argued that the Vision Pro was not a virtual reality (VR) platform, nor a competitor to Meta Platforms' Quest (formerly Oculus) product line, due to its positioning as ""primarily an AR device that just happens to have a few VR features"", and not as a mass market consumer product.[28]"

1-7	Apple today unveiled Apple Vision Pro, a revolutionary spatial computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, while allowing users to stay present and connected to others. Vision Pro creates an infinite canvas for apps that scales beyond the boundaries of a traditional display and introduces a fully three-dimensional user interface controlled by the most natural and intuitive inputs possible — a user’s eyes, hands, and voice. Featuring visionOS, the world’s first spatial operating system, Vision Pro lets users interact with digital content in a way that feels like it is physically present in their space. The breakthrough design of Vision Pro features an ultra-high-resolution display system that packs 23 million pixels across two displays, and custom Apple silicon in a unique dual-chip design to ensure every experience feels like it’s taking place in front of the user’s eyes in real time.
1-8	Extraordinary New Experiences Apple Vision Pro brings a new dimension to powerful, personal computing by changing the way users interact with their favorite apps, capture and relive memories, enjoy stunning TV shows and movies, and connect with others in FaceTime. An infinite canvas for apps at work and at home: visionOS features a three-dimensional interface that frees apps from the boundaries of a display so they can appear side by side at any scale. Apple Vision Pro enables users to be even more productive, with infinite screen real estate, access to their favorite apps, and all-new ways to multitask. And with support for Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, users can set up the perfect workspace or bring the powerful capabilities of their Mac into Vision Pro wirelessly, creating an enormous, private, and portable 4K display with incredibly crisp text.
1-9	Engaging entertainment experiences: With two ultra-high-resolution displays, Apple Vision Pro can transform any space into a personal movie theater with a screen that feels 100 feet wide and an advanced Spatial Audio system. Users can watch movies and TV shows, or enjoy stunning three-dimensional movies. Apple Immersive Video offers 180-degree high-resolution recordings with Spatial Audio, and users can access an exciting lineup of immersive videos that transport them to entirely new places. Spatial computing makes new types of games possible with titles that can span a spectrum of immersion and bring gamers into all-new worlds. Users can also play over 100 Apple Arcade games on a screen as large as they want, with incredible immersive audio and support for popular game controllers.
1-10	While the $3,499 Vision Pro won’t be available for sale until next year, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman recently reported that Apple is already working on a cheaper version. The news isn’t exactly surprising—Gurman himself previously reported on Apple’s plans to initially introduce the pricey mixed reality headset meant for developers, with a device meant for the masses released sometime later. Gurman covers some of the ways Apple could cut costs—lower-quality screens, an older chip, and fewer cameras among them—though much of the core Vision Pro features, including the EyeSight eye tracking, will likely remain. The projected release date for this other headset is late 2025, only two and a half years from now. Gurman doesn’t mention a smaller design, but it’s hard to imagine that Apple could develop the tech in that amount of time to make a headset that’s essentially a mobile device.
1-11	Apple has confirmed that Safari on Vision Pro will support WebXR, a web-standard that allows immersive experiences to be delivered through the browser. In a somewhat surprising move, Apple confirmed that Safari on Vision Pro will support WebXR. Prior to the reveal of the headset, it was an open question whether the company would entertain the idea of XR experiences through the browser, and even more so if the company would adopt the relatively new WebXR standard. But now Apple has confirmed that Safari on Vision Pro will indeed support WebXR. The company confirmed as much in its WWDC 2023 developer talk titled Meet Safari for Spatial Computing, in which the Apple explained the version of Safari running on Vision Pro is “truly is Safari with the same WebKit engine underneath, plus some thoughtful additions for [Vision Pro].” Thanks to Safari on visionOS being a fully-featured version of the browser, existing websites should work exactly as expected, the company says. But to go beyond flat web pages, Safari on visionOS includes support for WebXR for immersive experriences and the new <model> tag for 3D models.
1-12	The Apple Vision Pro stole the show at WWDC 2023. A showcase of all its features and functionality was an eye-opening insight into how Apple views the future direction augmented and virtual reality. While the ability to watch movies in a virtual environment has been around for ages, Apple’s partnership with Disney could produce some truly compelling experiences. And the interplay between Apple’s existing services and products and its vision for spatial computing shows the potential for the Vision Pro to spearhead the next step in AR and VR headsets. But a major sticking point is the price. At $3,499, the Vision Pro blows even the pricer VR headsets out of the water in terms of costs. Granted, there’s an awful lot of tech in the headset that could justify the loft price tag. But at the same time, we’re in a time when the cost of living is uncomfortably high for many. So the idea of splashing the cash on a device that’s somewhat niche in an area that’s already niche is hard to swallow.
1-13	Apple announced the Vision Pro, its first augmented reality (AR) headset, at its 5 June WWDC keynote. The headset contains two leading-edge micro-OLED displays packing an incredible 23 million pixels—nearly three times as many as in a 4K display. AR/VR display quality has improved in leaps and bounds since the original Oculus Rift, which had a single 1,280 x 800 display. But the need to balance price with quality has forced AR/VR leaders, such as Meta and HTC Corp., to compromise. Apple opts for a different strategy, pushing the device’s display technology, and the headset’s US $3,499 manufacturer’s suggested retail price, to the extreme.
1-14	Last year, MKBHD posted a video about the pass-through mode of the Meta Quest Pro. It's an impressive feature. But ultimately, it's something that has very limited use cases because the text quality is very low. The Vision Pro has excellent text quality and is very usable in this regard. So you can already do more with this than with a Quest. The only advantage so far is the huge number of special VR experiences for the Quest product family.
1-15	"Apple Vision Pro Captures 3D Spatial Videos and Photos Tuesday June 6, 2023 9:51 am PDT by Juli Clover Apple's new Vision Pro headset is equipped with an array of cameras for everything from eye scanning to gesture tracking, but it also has an external camera for capturing photos and videos. vision pro video recording The 3D camera on the Vision Pro takes 3D photos and records 3D videos that can be viewed back on the headset. Apple says that the feature is designed to allow users to relive their memories like never before. Standard photos from an iPhone or another device can also be viewed on the headset, but the 3D images will be much more immersive. vision pro 3d video Spatial videos and photos are designed to have ""incredible depth"" according to Apple, which lets the user ""see into a moment."" They can be expanded and zoomed in just like a regular photo. There is a button at the top of the headset that is designed to let users capture spatial videos or photos, and while recording is ongoing, the headset's external display flashes with an animation that lets the people around you know that video is being recorded. vision pro camera button With the recording indicator, no one will be able to use Vision Pro record video or take images in secret, which is a problem that prior headsets have faced. Google Glass, Google's now-defunct AR smart glasses, allowed for surreptitious photo and video recording in public spaces. Google came under fire for its capabilities, and some businesses even began banning the use of Google Glass. It is not clear if Apple will face some of the same issues with Vision Pro, but it at least makes it clear when a video is being recorded thanks to the unique external display. It's also not as lightweight and wearable as Google Glass, so it is unlikely many people will be wearing the Vision Pro out in public."
1-16	Apple announced a new Vision Pro VR headset with AR system to create a new virtual reality system. The headset is a standalone unit, priced at $3499, and features whole host of cameras that Apple are calling their first three-dimensional camera. There are six different external cameras (two forward facing, two downward facing, two side cameras), plus two TrueDepth cameras, plus a LiDAR scanner, used to see what is happening around you as well as track your hand movements. Inside the headset are another four more infrared cameras for eye-tracking, giving a total of 12 different cameras.
1-17	Apple Still Hasn't Discussed the Vision Pro's Weight and Optional Top Head Strap Friday June 9, 2023 2:31 am PDT by Tim Hardwick Coming away from all the press coverage and the demonstration videos that Apple released for its Vision Pro headset, most people would be forgiven for not realizing that there is an optional additional strap for the device that goes over the head. vision pro over head strap Still from Apple's WWDC keynote video showing over-the-head strap in use The additional strap is presumably used to better disperse weight and/or keep the headset from being easily dislodged when the wearer is moving around. It only appeared once in Apple's WWDC keynote, in a brief scene where a man stands and records a video of children playing with bubbles using the headset's outward facing cameras.
1-18	When will the Apple Vision Pro go on sale? Apple unveiled the Vison Pro headset at its WWDC 2023 convention, devoting more than 45 minutes to an in-depth reveal of the hardware. Don’t think that means you can pick one up though: the headset doesn’t go on sale until early 2024. Even then, it will only launch in the US at first, and only be available from official Apple stores. The company only says that other countries will follow “later next year,” but there’s no word on exactly when or where.
1-19	How much will the Vision Pro headset cost? Prepare to be shocked: Apple’s first AR/VR headset is expensive. When it launches the Reality Pro will start from $3,499 in the US – so far no other currencies have been confirmed. We’re not sure what pricing options there’ll be, but Apple has talked up the modularity and customisability of the design, so expect to be able to pay a premium for different headband options, plus the option Zeiss corrective lenses, rather than having a range of CPUs or storage to choose between. $3,499 is expensive even by VR standards. It’s more than double the $1,499/£1,499 Meta Quest Pro, and the equivalent of seven of the upcoming $499 Meta Quest 3 headset.
2-0	The 76th annual Cannes Film Festival is a film festival that took place from 16 to 27 May 2023.[1] Swedish filmmaker Ruben Östlund served as jury president.[2] With the French film Anatomy of a Fall winning the Palme d'Or, the festival's top prize,[3] Justine Triet became the third female director to achieve the prize, after Jane Campion in 1993, and Julia Ducournau in 2021.[4] The official poster for the festival featuring actress Catherine Deneuve was created by Lionel Avignon and Stefan de Vivies of the design studio Hartland Villa from a photo taken by Jack Garofalo during the shooting of La Chamade (1968). The poster was chosen to pay tribute to Deneuve for her contributions to film.[5] During the festival, two Honorary Palme d'Or were awarded: The first one during the opening ceremony for Michael Douglas; and the second one was awarded on short notice for Harrison Ford before the world premiere of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.[6] The festival opened with Jeanne du Barry directed by Maïwenn[7][8] and closed with Pixar's feature film Elemental directed by Peter Sohn.[9][10]
2-1	After an eventful few weeks at Cannes in the South of France, the film festival has come to its final moment: the Palme d’Or awards ceremony. Presented by Jane Fonda (who coincidentally prided the festival for the number of women nominated for the award), Justine Triet’s Anatomy Of A Fall has won the famed prize for the martial murder-mystery-thriller starring Sandra Hüller. This marked the fourth Palme d’Or winner acquired by Neon, after Titane, Triangle of Sadness, and Parasite. The jury, led by last year’s winner Triangle of Sadness’s Ruben Östlund, is made of actors, directors, and filmmakers from around the world like Julia Ducournau, Brie Larson, Rungano Nyoni, Maryam Touzani, Paul Dano, Denis Ménochet, Atiq Rahimi, and Damián Szifron. As for the ceremony itself, presenters for the evening included actors Song Kang-ho, Zar Amir Ebrahimi, John C. Reilly, and Pixar creative director Pete Docter, with actress Jane Fonda handing out the final prize.
2-2	The Cannes jury will hand out its awards on Saturday, May 27. The final predictions for which films and performances will win are listed below. The Cannes Film Festival has had its fair share of impressive movie premieres this year, with audiences embracing new films from the likes of Jonathan Glazer, Todd Haynes and Hirokazu Kore-eda. But even the most sustained standing ovation doesn’t guarantee that a movie will walk away with the Palme d’Or, Cannes’ highest honor. It all depends on the vagaries of the jury’s taste, and this one is headed up by Ruben Östlund, a two time Palme d’Or winner for “Triangle of Sadness” and “The Square.” And it’s not just Östlund’s decision to make. The ultimate victor will come down to the personal opinions of jury members Maryam Touzani, Denis Ménochet, Rungano Nyoni, Brie Larson, Paul Dano, Atiq Rahimi, Damián Szifrón and Julia Ducournau.
2-3	Justine Triet’s French courtroom thriller Anatomy of a Fall has won the 2023 Palme d’Or for best film of the 76th Cannes International Film Festival. Triet is just the third woman director to win Cannes’ top honor, but the second in three years, following Julia Ducournau, who took the Palme for Titane in 2021. Jane Campion was the first-ever female Palme d’Or winner in 1993 with The Piano. German actress Sandra Hüller stars in the film as a German novelist who is put on trial for murder after her husband dies in suspicious circumstances.
2-4	Acclaimed by the critics and winner of the Grand Prix at the 76th Cannes Film Festival, The Zone of Interest is one of the titles that received the most attention during this year’s festival. At the same time, out of all the movies I saw at the Cannes Film Festival, The Zone of Interest was definitely the hardest one to watch. And perhaps that is the whole point of Jonathan Glazer’s (Under The Skin) latest movie. After all, a film about a Nazi commander responsible for killing countless lives raises complex questions on the ethics of portraying such a topic on screen, all of which The Zone of Interest certainly takes strongly into consideration. The Zone of Interest is loosely based on a homonymous 2014 novel by Martin Amis, telling the story of a Nazi officer. In fact, Glazer’s film follows Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel), the commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp, as he builds his ideal life with his wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) and children in what initially looks like a fantastical house in the countryside of Germany. However, it becomes soon evident that behind this dream-like façade, there is a much darker truth, that of the Auschwitz concentration camp just a few feet away from them, the horror of which Höss is heavily involved in.
2-5	The Cannes Film Festival is officially back to celebrate this year’s best in international cinema, and stars are continuing to live up to the festival’s signature upscale glamour on the red carpet. On May 16, celebrities returned to the French Riviera in a series of extravagant ensembles that exude the kind of opulence reserved exclusively for the Cannes red carpet. Scheduled to run until May 27, the festival can be expected to showcase the most dramatic and luxurious outfits—whether they are custom-made, pulled from the latest runway shows, or unearthed from the archives. Click ahead to see every look, and keep watching this space for updates. The 76th annual Cannes Film Festival runs from Tuesday, May 16 to Saturday, May 27.
2-6	The 76th annual Cannes Film Festival got off to a controversial start when Maïwenn’s “Jeanne du Barry” played as the opening night selection last month. The period piece, which features Johnny Depp in a supporting role as French monarch Louis XV alongside Maïwenn’s eponymous protagonist, attracted as much attention for its cast’s personal lives as its artistic merit. The film marks Depp’s first major acting role in years, following his acrimonious defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard and widespread reporting about unprofessional behavior on movie sets. His director and co-star also found herself in the headlines before the film’s premiere for assaulting a journalist at a restaurant in France. The film premiered to moderate reviews and eventually secured an American distribution deal from Vertical. Depp’s colorful press conference at the festival attracted plenty of attention, and film industry observers have begun to speculate about the actor making a larger Hollywood comeback in the near future.
2-7	"French murder mystery film Anatomy of a Fall has taken the top prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival. Director Justine Triet won the Palme d'Or for her tense courtroom drama, which tells the story of a writer accused of her husband's murder. She becomes the third female director ever to win the prestigious prize, which was first awarded in 1955. Her thriller stars German actress Sandra Hüller, who also stars in the Cannes runner-up, The Zone of Interest. As she accepted the award, Triet slammed the French government over its response to recent pension protests. ""These protests were... repressed in a shocking way,"" she said in her speech, after being presented with the award by Hollywood star Jane Fonda."
2-8	Joining a roster of fellow A-listers, Jennifer Lawrence touched down in France this weekend for the annual Cannes Film Festival event. The actor is in town to attend the screenings of Bread and Roses, a documentary that Lawrence produced about the experiences of Afghanistan women under the Taliban. Earlier today, Lawrence attended both a daytime photo call and evening premiere for the documentary—and her polished attire exemplified the glitz and glamour of the festival. The star sported two striking looks that were envisioned by Christian Dior’s Maria Grazia Chiuri. (Lawrence has long been a Dior girl, of course.) For her daytime look, Lawrence wore a gray, knitted sheath dress from Dior’s spring 2023 couture collection. Slightly beachy in feel (appropriate for seaside Cannes), the coverall design with a deep-V in the back exposed a hint of a satin bra and briefs worn underneath. It was an effortless, and slightly unexpected, choice.
2-9	A year after collecting his second Palme d‘Or for “Triangle of Sadness,” Ruben Östlund bestowed the same honor to Justine Triet’s “Anatomy of a Fall,” a thought-provoking legal drama which purports to investigate the guilt or innocence of a popular novelist (Sandra Hüller), accused of murdering her husband. But the film is every bit as much an inquest into their marriage, bringing private details from the couple’s personal life into the courtroom for the press, public and audience to dissect, as if under a microscope. Triet is only the third woman to win the Palme d’Or (after Jane Campion for “The Piano” and “Titane” helmer Julia Ducournau, who joined Östlund on the jury this year). The prize was presented by Jane Fonda, who remarked on how far Cannes has come — setting a record for female representation, with seven woman helmers in competition this year — since the American star first attended. In accepting the award, Triet made a point of acknowledging the protests against French pension reform, which were forbidden from the festival.
2-10	After 11 days of an exceptional edition, the Jury of the 76th Festival de Cannes, chaired by Swedish director Ruben Östlund, surrounded by Moroccan director Maryam Touzani, French actor Denis Ménochet, British-Zambian screenwriter & director Rungano Nyoni, American actress & director Brie Larson, American actor & director Paul Dano, Afghan author Atiq Rahimi, Argentinian director & screenwriter Damián Szifron and French director Julia Ducournau, presented its winners’ list among the 21 films presented in Competition this year.
2-11	The 2023 Cannes Film Festival is jam-packed with buzzy world premieres, from Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” to Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City.” Todd Haynes is also back to unveil “May December,” featuring the A-list pairing of Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore, while Disney is bringing Harrison Ford to the Croisette for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.” New films from Pedro Almodovar, Jessica Hautner, Jonathan Glazer, Catherine Corsini, Hirokazu Kore-eda and more are also set to make their debuts at Cannes this year. Cannes is often seen as a launching pad for Oscar season. Warner Bros. in 2022 kicked off its lengthy awards run for Baz Luhrmann’s “Elvis” on the French Riviera, with the film going on to land eight Academy Award nominations, including best picture. Palme d’Or winner “Triangle of Sadness” also picked up Oscar nods for best picture, director and original screenplay. Two international film nominees, “Close” and “EO,” launched at last year’s festival, while “Aftersun” best actor nominee Paul Mescal got his awards start in the Directors Fortnight sidebar. All of this is to say the industry will be closely watching the buzz on all of this year’s world premieres.
2-12	Here, find the winners from the 76th edition of the festival. After 11 days, the Cannes Film Festival drew to a close on the evening of May 27. At the Palais des Festivals, the president of the jury, Ruben Östlund announced the winners. Here is the winners’ list for the 76th edition of the festival, from the Caméra d’Or to the highly coveted Palme d’Or prize. The winners of the Cannes Film Festival 2023 Palme d’Or: (Anatomy of a Fall) by Justine TRIET 2023 Les Films Pelléas / Les Films de Pierre Grand Prix: The Zone of Interest by Jonathan GLAZER Best Director: The Pot-au-Feu by Hung TRAN ANH Jury Prize: Fallen Leaves by Aki KAURISMAKI Best Screenplay: Yuji SAKAMOTO for Monster directed by KORE-EDA Hirokazu Best Performance by an Actress: Merve DIZDAR for About Dry Grasses directed by Nuri Bilge CEYLAN Nuri Bilge Ceylan Best Performance by an Actor: Kōji YAKUSHO for Perfect Days directed by Wim WENDERS MASTER MIND Ltd Caméra d’Or: Inside the Yellow Cocoon Shell by THIEN AN PHAM Palme d’Or for Short Film: 27 by Flóra Anna BUDA Mention spéciale: Intrusion by Gunnur MARTINSDÓTTIR SCHLÜTER
2-13	"Heading the pack for best film at the European Film Awards is Swedish comedy ""Triangle of Sadness,"" which is riding high on the back of its Palme d'Or win at Cannes. With the satire on the superrich that exposes a tenuous class hierarchy, filmmaker Ruben Ostlund also picked up nominations for best director and best screenwriter, while lead Zlatko Buric is up for best actor. The nominations for the film awards, the European equivalent of the Oscars, were announced on Tuesday (11.08.2022). The ceremony will take place on December 10 in the Icelandic capital, Reykjavík. Among the five films competing for the top gong, two other works also premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May. ""Close,"" a contemporary drama by Belgian filmmaker Lukas Dhont, explores a ""crisis of connection"" between two adolescent boys and won the Grand Prix in Cannes. Meanwhile, the thriller ""Holy Spider,"" by Danish director Ali Abbasi, sees a young female journalist investigate the serial killings of sex workers in Iran's holy city of Mashhad. Based on true events, the Danish, German, Swedish and French co-production won the Prix Un Certain Regard in Cannes, and was chosen as Sweden's Academy Award entry while enjoying a wide international release."

2-15	The world’s most prestigious, glamorous, and sometimes controversial film festival, Cannes is a can’t-miss event even if you’re thousands of miles from the Croisette. This year features high-profile premieres ranging from star-studded Hollywood fare (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City) to the auteur-driven work the festival is famous for (see: virtually everything in competition). Last year’s festival debuted future Oscar contenders Elvis, Top Gun: Maverick, Aftersun, and Palme d’Or winner Triangle of Sadness, which means that, yes, awards season in some ways starts here too. This year, Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson and Rebecca Ford will be on the ground at Cannes to catch all the gala premieres, headline-making interviews, and all the moments that will define Cannes this year. Of course, the festival is as famous for parties as for its films, and Vanity Fair has a major one to look forward to this year. In our live blog below, we’ll be chronicling the films, the fashion, and the moments from inside our party you can’t find anywhere else. On se voit au cinéma!
2-16	Cinematic trends at this year’s early-summer film festival in Cannes included but were not limited to: men in positions of absolute power corrupting it absolutely, characters papering over their ethical missteps with the help of some extreme mental compartmentalization, May-December relationships that gave us the ick while also making us laugh, young people gyrating on each other, Sandra Hüller, stories within stories within stories, Leonardo DiCaprio talking to Robert De Niro, general depravity, and the Weeknd telling Lily-Rose Depp to “suffocate on my cock.” Never boring, sometimes French, often provocative, and always unpredictable, here are our two Cannes correspondents on the festival movies you’ll want to watch out for in 2023:
2-17	Cannes 2024 All about the next Cannes Film Festival. For 12 days each May, the city of Cannes is transformed from a quiet seaside resort into the densest concentration of film industry activity on the planet. Over 200,000 people - filmmakers, film fans, studio executives, and star-gazers alike - decend on the Croisette to take part in the the Festival de Cannes, more commonly known to English-speakers as the Cannes Film Festival.
2-18	Festival season has officially been kickstarted with the Cannes Film Festival, a glamorous 11-day event held in the South of France where thousands of celebrities, filmmakers, industry members, and cinephiles gather every May to celebrate the most anticipated titles of the year. Among the hundreds of films programmed across several sections, a handful are based on rich literary source material, both fiction and nonfiction. With this year’s 76th edition of the festival officially wrapped, we gathered our thoughts on a selection of the book-to-film adaptations that made their debuts on the Croisette.
2-19	Good news for major red carpet fans: The 2023 Cannes Film Festival is officially underway in Cannes, France. The annual event, which premieres and screens some of the most-discussed films of the year, produces one of the most lavish step and repeats in the world. It’s a fashion spectacle on par with the Oscars and Met Gala, and a decidedly much more formal one than other film festivals like Venice or TIFF. We’re bound to receive some top-tier fashion on La Croisette, thanks to a star-studded lineup of new projects. Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City stars Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, Tilda Swinton, and Margot Robbie; Todd Haynes’s May December features Julianne Moore and Natalie Portman; and Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon is anchored by Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone, Robert De Niro, and Brendan Fraser. If all these names aren’t enough, there’s also the 2023 Cannes jury, with members such as Brie Larson, Paul Dano, and Julia Ducournau. Cannes has a history of delivering spellbinding style moments, after all. Glamorous moments from past years include Diana, Princess of Wales’s Catherine Walker gown in 1987, Madonna’s 1991 Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra, and Amal Clooney’s sunny Atelier Versace gown in 2016. More recently, model Bella Hadid made waves with her 2021 Schiaparelli Couture dress and gold, lung-like breastplate. What will be the fashion mood at this year’s Cannes? There’s only one way to find out. Be sure to check back here for all of the best red carpet looks from the 2023 Cannes Film Festival as it’s updated in real time, and be sure to check back at the end of the week for Vogue’s ultimate Best Dressed list from Cannes.
3-0	Linda Yaccarino, a former NBCUniversal marketing executive, on Monday officially took over the CEO role at Twitter from Elon Musk, weeks after the billionaire announced hiring her for the top spot at the social media company. “It happened — first day in the books!,” Yaccarino tweeted late Monday. “Stay tuned…” A day earlier, Yaccarino had tweeted that Twitter had hired Joe Benarroch, NBCU’s former senior vice president of communications for advertising and partnerships, to join her at the company. Benarroch will work in business operations, according to his LinkedIn profile. “Let’s get to work @Twitter! #timetofly” Yaccarino said in the tweet.
3-1	Elon Musk said Thursday that Twitter is getting a new CEO and that he will move to a product and technical role. Musk said via Twitter that the new CEO, whom he didn’t name, would start in about six weeks. NBCUniversal global advertising chair Linda Yaccarino is in advanced talks for the role, CNBC’s Julia Boorstin reported, citing sources. He added that he would transition “to being exec chair & CTO, overseeing product, software & sysops.” Tesla shares jumped more than 2%, in a sign that investors were pleased about the move. Several Tesla investors were concerned that Musk was too distracted by running Twitter and that he should redirect his time to steering the electric vehicle company, where he is also CEO. In April, a host of progressive Tesla shareholders publicly urged Tesla’s board to ensure that Musk would dedicate more time to the automobile company. Musk, who is also CEO of the reusable rocket maker SpaceX, completed the $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in October and made his mark there immediately. He fired the company’s top executives and laid off hundreds of employees.
3-2	Elon Musk made it official, announcing Linda Yaccarino is the new CEO of Twitter. Elon Musk has announced plans for a new Twitter CEO but hasn’t said who it is. In a tweet on Thursday, Musk says that he has “hired a new CEO for X/Twitter” and that “she will be starting in ~6 weeks.” Musk will instead assume the role of executive chair and chief technology officer, “overseeing product, software & sysops” of Twitter. According to Dylan Byers of Puck News, the new CEO will be NBC Universal advertising executive Linda Yaccarino, citing two unnamed sources. On Friday morning, NBCUniversal confirmed Yaccarino has resigned,
3-3	"Elon Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter in October 2022, Elon Musk acted as CEO of Twitter until he stepped down in June 2023 and was replaced by Linda Yaccarino.[1] During that timeframe, the company introduced a series of reforms and management changes. Musk reinstated a number of previously banned accounts such as that of Donald Trump, reduced the workforce by approximately 80%, closed one of Twitter's three data centers, largely eliminated the content moderation team and replaced it with a new feature called Community Notes, and instituted a plan that charged personal users $8 per month to get a ""verified"" blue badge and $1,000 per month for an organizational gold badge. Musk has been the subject of widespread criticism from those that believed content moderation should be continued. A series of reports called the Twitter Files were released, intended to shed light on content moderation, censorship, and government influence at the social media company prior to Musk's acquisition."
3-4	"A group of 17 music publishers in the US has sued Twitter, claiming the platform enabled copyright violations involving nearly 1,700 songs. The National Music Publishers' Association (NMPA) is seeking more than $250m (£197.7m) in damages. In a lawsuit filed at the Federal District Court in Nashville, the NMPA claimed Twitter ""permits and encourages infringement"" for profit. It says the situation has not improved since Elon Musk bought the company. The NMPA, which represents firms - including Sony Music Publishing, BMG Rights Management and Universal Music Publishing Group - alleged that Twitter continues to ""reap huge profits from the availability of unlicensed music without paying the necessary licensing fees for it"". It added that the infringements have given Twitter an ""unfair advantage"" over competitors - including TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat - which pay for music licences. Twitter ""stands alone as the largest social media platform that has completely refused to license the millions of songs on its service,"" NMPA President David Israelite said in a statement. Twitter did not directly respond to a BBC request for comment."
3-5	Details Transcript June 20, 2023 In late October 2022, Elon Musk officially took Twitter private and became the company’s majority shareholder, finally ending a months-long acquisition saga. He appointed himself CEO and brought in his own team to clean house. Musk needed to take decisive steps to succeed against the major opposition to his leadership from both inside and outside the company. Twitter employees circulated an open letter protesting expected layoffs, advertising agencies advised their clients to pause spending on Twitter, and EU officials considered a broader Twitter ban. What short-term actions should Musk take to stabilize the situation, and how should he approach long-term strategy to turn around Twitter? Harvard Business School assistant professor Andy Wu and co-author Goran Calic, associate professor at McMaster University’s DeGroote School of Business, discuss Twitter as a microcosm for the future of media and information in their case, “Twitter Turnaround and Elon Musk.”
3-6	Elon Musk recently said Twitter’s advertising business was on the upswing. “Almost all advertisers have come back,” he asserted, adding that the social media company could soon become profitable. But Twitter’s U.S. advertising revenue for the five weeks from April 1 to the first week of May was $88 million, down 59 percent from a year earlier, according to an internal presentation obtained by The New York Times. The company has regularly fallen short of its U.S. weekly sales projections, sometimes by as much as 30 percent, the document said. That performance is unlikely to improve anytime soon, according to the documents and seven current and former Twitter employees.
3-7	"Famed Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling caused a stir on Twitter after Elon Musk announced that the terms ""cis"" and ""cisgender"" would be considered slurs on the platform. In Twitter post, Rowling — who has sparked controversy and even boycotts for her comments on sexual orientation in the past — said that ""cis"" is an ""ideological language"" and ""the rest of us have a right to disagree."" ""'Cis' is ideological language, signifying belief in the unfalsifiable concept of gender identity,"" Rowling wrote Wednesday, June 21. She added: ""You have a perfect right to believe in unprovable essences that may or may not match the sexed body, but the rest of us have a right to disagree, and to refuse to adopt your jargon."""
3-8	Elon Musk says he has found a new CEO for Twitter. Musk did not specify who will be taking on the role, though The Wall Street Journal is now reporting that NBCUniversal Head of Advertising Linda Yaccarino is “in talks” for the position. In a tweet, Musk announced that he will transition from his role as CEO of the social network to serving as its executive chair and chief technology officer. The new CEO is expected to start in six weeks, according to Musk. “Excited to announce that I’ve a new CEO for X/Twitter,” Musk wrote in the tweet. “She will be starting in ~6 weeks! My role will transition to being exec chair & CTO, overseeing product, software & sysops.”
3-9	eSafety, an Australian online safety watchdog has posted a public report, in which they “demand answers from Twitter” about the state of online hate stemming from the platform. The report claims that eSafety has seen a massive increase in complaints since Elon Musk took over in October 2022. They also say the complaints are more than “any other platform”. Should Twitter not respond to eSafety’s latest report, the company could see a maximum fine of $700,000 a day until the watchdog is satisfied that it isn’t “continuing breaches.” eSafety says that this rise in online hate correlates with the company’s mass layoffs. The workforce was reduced from 8000 to 1500 and is now estimated to be around 1000. These layoffs saw a large portion of Twitter’s trust and safety teams let go, and at the start of June, the head of the department resigned.
3-10	"Elon Musk said at a conference in Paris: ""If I'm so smart then why did I pay so much for Twitter?"" The Tesla CEO said he spent $44 billion as he was ""concerned"" about Twitter's ""negative"" effects. Musk also said he was worried Twitter was having a ""corrosive"" impact on society. When you're worth $229 billion, maybe it's not so hard to joke about dropping $44 billion on a takeover. That's what Elon Musk did on Friday at a conference in Paris, quipping: ""If I'm so smart, why did I pay so much for Twitter then?"" While admitting the deal was ""expensive,"" he said he decided to buy the social media network because he was a big tweeter – and was worried about it ""moving in a negative direction"". ""I was concerned Twitter was having a negative affect on civilization and corrosive affect on civil society, and anything that undermines civilization, I think, isn't good,"" he told the VivaTech conference."
3-11	At a gathering of Meta staff last week, Chris Cox, one of Mark Zuckerberg’s most trusted lieutenants, unveiled what he called “our response to Twitter”. The product chief showed off what has internally been codenamed “Project 92”, or in some iterations “Barcelona”: a prototype app that the Facebook-developer hopes will finally kill its rival. The app is expected to be called Threads and screenshots suggest it will feature a continuous scroll of text like Twitter with buttons similar to the Like and Retweet functions, according to technology news site The Verge. Zuckerberg’s company is already courting celebrities and influencers to test the app. Meta has been negotiating with TV host Oprah Winfrey and Tibetan religious leader the Dalai Lama to open accounts, hoping that high-profile early users can help tempt the masses to join.
3-12	Twitter cofounder Evan Williams seems pretty upset over how things are panning out at the company under new owner Elon Musk. In his first interview since Musk took Twitter private in a landmark $44 billion deal, Williams told Bloomberg’s The Circuit With Emily Chang that he originally believed the notion of Musk taking over Twitter was “interesting and fun.” However, he revealed, by the time the deal closed, his stance had changed, and he was in fact “sad when the purchase actually went through.” After attempting to pull out of the acquisition, citing concerns over the number of bot—or fake—accounts on the platform, Musk, the world’s wealthiest person, eventually decided—under legal pressure—to buy the company. Williams, who was Twitter CEO between 2008 and 2010, is no longer a Twitter shareholder, but as one of the company’s first stakeholders has been closely watching the drama around the Musk-led Twitter unfold. “I don’t think he’s dialed it in quite right yet,” Williams said of Musk in the interview, which aired Thursday night. “I think he’s brilliant. But no one’s brilliant on everything.”
3-13	Elon Musk's decision not to pay Twitter's rent is causing pain for Goldman Sachs, the FT reported. Goldman helped originate a $1.7 billion loan to Columbia Property, which owns many Twitter offices. Columbia is suing Twitter, accusing the company of not paying more than $100,000 as of December. Elon Musk's decision not to pay rent on Twitter's offices is causing pain to Goldman Sachs' commercial-mortgage portfolio. Citing data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Financial Times reported this week that Goldman Sachs' banking arm saw the value of delinquent commercial-real-estate loans rise 612% to $840 million over the first quarter. That dwarfs the rise of commercial-real-estate delinquencies across the US banking industry, with bad commercial real-estate loans rising just 30% nationwide, notching $12 billion over the first quarter.
3-14	"Two of the world's most high-profile technology billionaires - Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg - have agreed to fight each other in a cage match. Mr Musk posted a message on his social media platform Twitter that he was ""up for a cage fight"" with Mr Zuckerberg. Mr Zuckerberg, the boss of Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta, then posted a screenshot of Mr Musk's tweet with the caption ""send me location"". ""The story speaks for itself,"" a Meta spokesperson told the BBC. Mr Musk then replied to Mr Zuckerberg's response with: ""Vegas Octagon."" The Octagon is the competition mat and fenced-in area used for Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) bouts. The UFC is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mr Musk, who turns 52 later this month, also tweeted: ""I have this great move that I call 'The Walrus', where I just lie on top of my opponent & do nothing."" He later tweeted short videos of walruses, perhaps suggesting his challenge to Mr Zuckerberg may not entirely be serious. Skip twitter post by Elon Musk"
3-15	Twitter owner Elon Musk has been sued by the social media company’s employees alleging that he has refused to pay their 2022 bonuses. The former Twitter CEO had promised to pay at least 50 per cent of the Twitter employees’ target amounts as bonuses last year. According to a Bloomberg report, the class-action lawsuit is filed by Mark Shobinger who was working as Twitter’s senior director of compensation until last month. Shobinger said that he filed the lawsuit on behalf of current and former Twitter employees who haven’t received their promised bonuses.
3-16	In Short Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey made sensational claims about the Indian government threatening to shut down the company. Musk praised Prime Minister Modi, acknowledging his genuine concern for India and his efforts to encourage significant investment in the country. Musk also highlighted India's potential for solar energy investment and described his discussions with Prime Minister Modi as excellent. By Ankita Chakravarti: Twitter chief Elon Musk met PM Narender Modi in the United States of India. During his meeting with the Prime Minister, Musk expressed his enthusiasm for India's future. Musk emphasized that India holds great promise compared to other large countries, and he is incredibly excited about what lies ahead. Musk's meeting happened days after former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey made sensational claims about the Indian government threatening to shut down the company for not abiding with content takedown orders during a 2020-2021 farmers' protest.
3-17	In totally normal news, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter owner Elon Musk might be duking it out in a high-profile fight. It all started with a Musk response on a Jun. 20 Twitter thread mocking Zuckerberg, which stated, “I’m up for a cage match if he is lol.” The crack was in response to a user saying Zuckerberg “does the ju jitsu [sic] now,” a reference to his recent medaling in a Brazilian jiu-jitsu tournament.
3-18	"Billionaire Elon Musk spoke to a French broadcaster about respecting EU content moderation rules. Twitter will abide by EU laws to combat disinformation and hate speech online, billionaire Elon Musk confirmed in an interview with French broadcaster France 2 on the sidelines of VivaTech. ""Twitter will obey the law. If laws are passed, Twitter will obey the law,"" Musk insisted, in an interview that was dubbed in French by the broadcaster. It was in response to a question about the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), which came into force late last year. The EU law creates obligations for large digital platforms to reduce harm and protect consumer rights. He qualified, however, that the social media platform he took over last year would not go ""beyond the will of the people as expressed by the law"". Musk has served as the company's CEO since the takeover but recently designated a new chief executive to take the reins."
3-19	Twitter owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk suggested Vegas for the location of a “cage match” after reportedly being challenged to a fight by Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. “Vegas Octagon,” Musk tweeted late Wednesday. He was responding to an Instagram post by Zuckerberg who had shot back with a message of “send me location” after the Tesla boss confirmed he was up for a “cage match.” Cage matches have been popularized by mixed martial arts or MMA franchises like UFC. The “Octagon” refers to the cage around the ring in which fighters battle because it has eight sides. The series of exchanges started earlier this week when Mario Nawfal, founder and CEO at International Blockchain Consulting, tweeted “META to Release ‘Twitter Rival’ Called THREADS.” Facebook parent Meta is reportedly working on a standalone, text-based social network app that could compete with Twitter.
4-0	Erling Haaland ended the 2022-23 league campaign with 36 goals: a Premier League record in a single season by a player. That’s scary enough, but considering this was his first season in the Premier League and that he’ll only just have turned 23 years old at the start of 2023-24, you wonder how soon he’ll be threatening the Premier League all-time goal record. He’s currently on 52 goals from 52 appearances in all competitions in 2022-23, with this by far the greatest goalscoring campaign by a player at a Premier League club within a single season. His 52 goals have seen him surpass both Mohamed Salah’s (2017-18 for Liverpool) and Ruud van Nistelrooy’s (2002-03 for Manchester United) 44-goal tallies in a season of competitive action for a Premier League club. This record was broken as quickly as in his 39th appearance of the season for Man City, and his side still have the UEFA Champions League final against Inter Milan to play on Saturday.
4-1	Of course, football didn’t begin in 1992 with the introduction of the Premier League. Dixie Dean holds the all-time record for competitive goals in a single season for a top-flight club. His 63 goals for Everton in 1927-28 came in just 41 matches (1.54 goals per game) and he had 11 more than Haaland has at this stage of his season (39 appearances). There’s no chance that Haaland could break Dean’s all-time English record, with the Man City star needing 11 goals against Inter Milan in the 2022-23 UCL final to even draw level with the Everton great.
4-2	Erling Haaland has finished as top scorer in the 2022/23 UEFA Champions League with 12 goals, four more than second-ranked Mohamed Salah. The Norwegian forward struck five times in the group stage and doubled his season's tally by becoming only the third player to score five in a single Champions League match, in the round of 16 second leg against Leipzig. He also struck in both legs of the quarter-final triumph over Bayern and, though they were his last goals in the competition, that proved enough for Haaland to take the prize 2022/23 Champions League top scorers 12 Erling Haaland (Man City 8 Mohamed Salah (Liverpool 7 Vinícius Júnior (Real Madrid 7 Kylian Mbappé (Paris 6 João Mário (Benfica 5 Olivier Giroud (Milan 5 Robert Lewandowski (Barcelona 5 Victor Osimhen (Napoli 5 Rodrygo (Real Madrid 5 Rafa Silva (Benfica)  5 Mehdi Taremi (Porto)
4-3	Erling Haaland is only 22, but the Manchester City forward has been rewriting record books since he announced himself in the competition with a first-half hat-trick on his debut, also becoming only the third player to score five times in a UEFA Champions League match. Erling Haaland has scored 35 goals in just 30 UEFA Champions League appearances, rewriting the record books in the process. Still just 22 and in only his fourth campaign in the competition, the Norway striker is already 19th in the list of all-time Champions League scorers and having gone above the likes of Samuel Eto'o, Antoine Griezmann, Kaká and Wayne Rooney, is now within sight of Edinson Cavani, Sergio Agüero and Alessandro Del Piero.
4-4	Manchester City claimed their first Champions League title and completed a famous treble for the club as they beat Inter Milan 1-0 in a tension-filled night at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul. The Italian club had done brilliantly to limit their much favoured opponents for the majority of the match but Rodri's 68th minute strike proved enough for the Citizens to become European football's premier champions. As a result, City manager Pep Guardiola lifted the Champions League trophy for a third time, an honour that only Carlo Ancelotti can better thanks to his four competition wins. The Sporting News has dug into the data behind the game, with all the key stats and facts below.
4-5	The Norway international has been scoring for fun throughout his career, but just how many times in total has he found the net? Death, taxes and Erling Haaland scoring. The three certainties in life. The Manchester City attacker has been scoring for fun following his move to the Premier League, but the 2022-23 campaign is by no means the first time he's been making headlines for his lethal finishing. He did it at Borussia Dortmund. He did it at Red Bull Salzburg. He did it at Molde. And he did it during his time with the Bryne youth academy. And we haven't even talked about his performances for the national team at both youth and senior level yet. Remember when he scored nine goals in one game at the Under-20 World Cup in 2019?! Yes, we agree, the man is an absolute phenomenon and he seems destined to break all sorts of goalscoring records in the years to come. Just how many goals has he scored so far, though? Let's take a look.
4-6	The 2023 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League, the 68th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA and the 31st season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, on 10 June 2023,[5] between English club Manchester City and Italian club Inter Milan. Manchester City won the match 1–0 to clinch their first ever Champions League title, thus completing a continental treble.[6][7] As winners, they earned the right to play against the winners of the 2022–23 UEFA Europa League, Sevilla, in the 2023 UEFA Super Cup, and qualified for the FIFA Club World Cup in both 2023 and 2025. The final was originally scheduled to be played at Wembley Stadium in London, England. However, due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the scheduled hosts for subsequent finals were shifted back a year, and the Allianz Arena in Munich was assigned the 2023 final.[8] When the 2021 final, which had been scheduled to be played in Istanbul, also had to be relocated due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2023 final was given to Istanbul instead, and Munich received the 2025 final.[9]
4-7	Manchester City began the final with Kyle Walker on the bench and replaced by Nathan Aké in the starting line-up in an unexpected change; Inter Milan retained the same starting line-up that had played in previous rounds.[55] The two sides had scoring chances early in the first half, but Inter's André Onana made two saves to prevent City from taking the lead.[56] A misplayed pass from Ederson in the 26th minute was stolen by Nicolò Barella, but his shot over the goalkeeper missed.[57][58] Kevin De Bruyne left the match in the 36th minute with a hamstring injury and was replaced by Phil Foden.[59] The first half ended scoreless, with Inter playing defensively to prevent City from gaining momentum.
4-8	Romelu Lukaku was brought on to replace former City striker Edin Džeko early in the second half and immediately produced a chance from a header. In the 59th minute, Ederson failed to collect a backpass from Manuel Akanji which was found by Inter's Lautaro Martínez; his shot from near the touchline was blocked by Ederson.[58] Rodri scored the opening goal for City in the 68th minute by finishing a pulled-back pass that Bernardo Silva sent from near the goal to the top of the penalty area.[56][57] Inter had a chance to equalise three minutes later through a header by defender Federico Dimarco that hit the crossbar. Dimarco tried to capitalise on the rebound as well, but his shot was blocked by Lukaku.[56] The Belgian striker had his own chance to score from a close-range header in the 89th minute, which Ederson blocked with his legs.[58] The Brazilian made an additional save in stoppage time off Robin Gosens's header to preserve a 1–0 victory for City.[57]
4-9	Manchester City won the first Champions League in their history on Saturday and secured a treble of trophies by beating Inter Milan 1-0. In a far closer match than many pundits had predicted, Rodri's sweetly-struck goal proved the difference for Abu Dhabi-backed City, who have already won the Premier League and FA Cup this season. Rodri sidefooted in on 68 minutes after Bernardo Silva pulled back a cross that fell perfectly for the unmarked Spaniard at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium. It sealed the third Champions League for City manager Pep Guardiola, who won it twice with Barcelona.
4-10	After a record-breaking six months, Manchester City's Julian Alvarez has booked his place in history as the first player to win a treble of European Cup, league and domestic cup - and a World Cup - in the same season. Nine players before the 23-year-old Argentine forward had won the European Cup or Champions League and the World Cup in the same season - but none had won the domestic double as well. Alvarez finishes the season as City's second top scorer with 17 goals, despite starting fewer than half their games, and was the third top scorer at the 2022 World Cup. City won the Premier League title by five points from Arsenal, beat Manchester United in the FA Cup final and saw off Inter Milan in the Champions League final - after Argentina beat France in the World Cup final in December. Alvarez did not get on the pitch in their 1-0 win over Inter in Istanbul but still got his hands on the trophy afterwards.
4-11	For sporting greatness to be achieved, there needs to be a defining moment. The Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul on Saturday was Manchester City’s, the scene where an obsession finally became reality and history was made. Ever since Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan and the Abu Dhabi United Group took ownership of the club in 2008, winning Europe’s premier cup competition had been the ultimate aim. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent in the last 15 years, and controversy has surrounded the club, but now the Champions League is, finally, theirs after a 1-0 win over Inter Milan which will live long in the memory for the significance of the result, rather than the match itself. This was not only a night when City won its first Champions League. In beating three-time champion Inter, Pep Guardiola’s side became only the second English team to achieve the treble, winning the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League in the same season.
4-12	Bernardo Silva went close in the first five minutes for City, while Erling Haaland had his best chance of the match in the 26th minute, forcing a low save from Inter goalkeeper André Onana. The Norwegian’s effort came minutes after Nicolò Barella spotted City goalkeeper Ederson off his line and took aim at goal only to skew his first-time strike dreadfully wide. That was as good as it got in the first half as Inter’s high-energy, aggressive pressing left City with plenty of possession but little to show for it. The second half was just as fraught, Inter continuing to defend brilliantly, City continuing to probe for openings. Yet, once Rodri put City ahead in the 68th minute, his curling first-time shot from a Bernardo Silva cut-back beating several Inter defenders, Inter could have at least have scored twice. Federico Dimarco’s header struck the crossbar, while his follow-up effort from six-yards out hit teammate Romelu Lukaku. In the closing minutes, Ederson stopped a Lukaku header from point-blank range for a save that secured the trophy for City.
4-13	The 2022-23 UEFA Champions League winners will be crowned in Istanbul, Türkiye, next Saturday (10 June). That Manchester City have reached their second Champions League Final is no great surprise given their latest English Premier League success. And Pep Guardiola’s men are heavy favourites to defeat Inter and finally claim the most lucrative prize in club football. The Italians emerged from a hugely competitive Group C, finishing second to Bayern Munich but ahead of Barcelona, and have benefitted from a slightly easier pathway in the knockout stages. While City had to get past Bayern and defending champions Real Madrid to make the final, Inter beat Portuguese sides FC Porto and Benfica before defeating city rivals M****ilan to make the final. They will somehow have to stop top scorer Erling Haaland from adding to his 12 goals during the campaign, and Kevin De Bruyne who leads the tournament with seven assists.
4-14	Kevin De Bruyne has lived a charmed life. From Sergio Agüero and Romelu Lukaku to Samuel Eto’o and Fernando Torres, the midfielder has had his share of lethal strikers to finish the chances he’s created. But even with those bounty of riches, none quite compare to Erling Haaland. The Norwegian has scored a remarkable 52 goals so far in all competitions in his debut season in England, with De Bruyne providing assists for 13 of those. Together, the pair have combined brilliantly to take Man City to the brink of history. City has won the Premier League and the FA Cup this season and faces Inter Milan in the Champions League final in Istanbul on Saturday hoping to become only the second English side to win ‘the treble’ – all three major trophies in a single season. During his glittering career, De Bruyne has learned about the connection between midfielder and attacker, something Haaland has capitalized on.
4-15	The two most iconic goals in Manchester City’s history – the former securing their first Premier League title, the latter completing a feat only ever achieved once before by an English club. Man City are finally European champions. Rodri’s beautifully shaped strike in Istanbul was enough to seal a 1-0 win over Inter Milan in Saturday’s UEFA Champions League final, writing this City team and himself into the history books. Legendary status awaits for both, with Pep Guardiola’s side becoming only the second English team to ever win the league, FA Cup and European Cup/Champions League in a single season.
4-16	"Henry's advice to Haaland that has gone viral With the former Arsenal forward considered one of the greats of the English game, it made sense for Haaland to seek him out. ""You don't do anything worse than anyone else, but with your back to goal, if you went more often to the right... there's room for learning,"" Henry explained. Assuring the Norwegian that if the movement he normally makes to the left was also mastered on the other side and with the other foot, his goal output would be even stronger. ""You would score 100 goals. You would score 100 goals a week,"" he concluded. Haaland thanked him for his comment with a laugh, reminded that he is only 22 years old and assured fans that he is constantly learning as a footballer."
4-17	Ever since he watched Manchester United overcome Chelsea on penalties in the 2008 final, Erling Haaland has been in love with the Champions League So much so that the striker was caught on video listening to the tournament’s anthem in his car while at Red Bull Salzburg and also used it as his wake-up alarm Haaland dreamed of playing and scoring in the competition — and winning it Manchester City bought the 22-year-old last summer from Borussia Dortmund for £52 million ($65 million) and tasked him to help them finally win European football’s biggest prize, having won every major domestic trophy “I have been coming here for a reason,” said Haaland But in a surprising confession, he says he feels “pressure” to help deliver that elusive first success — craved by the club’s Abu Dhabi owners since their 2008 takeover The Norwegian has had an incredible debut season with the Etihad outfit, scoring a record-breaking 52 goals.
4-18	Manchester City have completed a historic treble and are finally kings of the UEFA Champions League, defeating Inter Milan 1-0 in the 2023 UCL Final on Saturday at Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul. It's been a long time coming for the Sky Blues, which fell to Chelsea in the 2021 UCL Final before a disappointing semifinal loss to eventual champion Real Madrid last year. Manchester City needed just one goal to win its first Champions League title, and Rodri delivered in the 68th minute with just his second-ever goal in the competition to lift the Premier League side to victory.
4-19	Manchester City completed the treble with a hard-fought 1-0 win over Inter Milan in the Champions League final in Istanbul. Rodri’s side-footed finish midway through the second half broke Inter’s resistance and though Federico Dimarco hit the crossbar with a header before Ederson saved sensationally from Romelu Lukaku, City held on to make history in the Ataturk Olympic Stadium. Having already overhauled Arsenal to retain the Premier League trophy and beaten Manchester United to lift the FA Cup at Wembley, this victory saw them match the achievement of their city rivals in 1999. Pep Guardiola was in tears afterwards. The Catalan coach has won it all at City but this was the one they have been waiting for - champions of Europe for the first time. For Guardiola, it ends his 12-year wait to win the competition for a third time as a coach and a fourth time overall.
5-0	The LaLiga season hadn't even finished when Real Madrid's summer transfer business began. Madrid announced on June 3 that Marco Asensio, Mariano Diaz and Eden Hazard would be leaving the club. A day later -- hours before Madrid's last game of the season against Athletic Club -- Karim Benzema's name was added to that list. Then, 72 hours after the season's end, Borussia Dortmund confirmed that midfielder Jude Bellingham would join Madrid for an initial €103 million fee. Two days later, Madrid made official the return of left-back Fran Garcia from Rayo Vallecano, followed by Brahim Diaz heading back after a three-year loan at AC Milan. Last Monday, the club made it clear where the team's future lies, handing Vinicius Junior the No. 7 shirt, and Rodrygo Goes the No. 11.
5-1	Former Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema has signed a deal to join Saudi Arabia’s Al Ittihad football club on a three-year deal, according to the club. The announcement on Tuesday comes a day after the Gulf kingdom revealed plans to privatise its biggest football clubs in a bid to increase revenue and attract big-name players. Without disclosing details of the deal or Benzema’s salary, the club said in a statement that Benzema had undergone a medical examination and completed the signing in Madrid on Monday.
5-2	"MADRID (AP) — Karim Benzema will not stay with Real Madrid next season, the club said Sunday. Real Madrid said it reached an agreement with the French striker to “to bring his brilliant and unforgettable time as a player at our club to a close.” Madrid said Benzema “has represented the values"" of Madrid and “has earned the right to decide his future.” The announcement comes amid reports that Benzema will play in Saudi Arabia. “Real Madrid would like to show our gratitude and affection to a player who is already one of our greatest legends,” the club said. “Fans all over the world alike have enjoyed his magical and unique football, which has made him one of the great icons of our club and one of the great legends of world football.”"
5-3	"After playing 14 years with Real Madrid, Karim Benzema decided to end his time as a Merengue player. However, a few days ago I stopped following the club on their social networks and thus erase their merengue past. ""Had the dream to sign with the Real Madrid and withdraw me here, but the life sometimes gives another opportunity"", went the words that pronounce Karim Benzema in his act of farewell. Of this form, the French forward, put them end to his 14 years defending the colours of the group merengue. Apparently, it existed a narrow relation between the player, the fans and the club, but when seeming something change internally between all the involved of this history."
5-4	"Real Madrid legend Hugo Sanchez has urged the club to sign an attacker this summer. This comes after Los Blancos lost club legend Karim Benzema to Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad. ""When Cristiano left, there was Benzema. Now it's different, Real Madrid need to act immediately - Joselu is a great solution, but it's clear the club needs someone else too, some elite player who brings the goals."" Spanish striker Joselu, who has been signed from recently-relegated Espanyol on loan, is likely to be a backup option. The La Liga giants also have Uruguayan teenager Alvaro Rodriguez in their ranks, who impressed in his call-ups to the senior squad. He is expected to play a greater role in the upcoming season."
5-5	"MADRID, June 4 (Reuters) - Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema will leave Real Madrid as a free agent in the close season after 14 trophy-laden years, the LaLiga club said on Sunday, with the striker set to move to Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad. Saudi Arabia's state-run Al Ekhbariya television station reported that Al Ittihad had reached an agreement with Benzema on a two-year contract, with club officials in Madrid to hammer out a ""record deal"" with the striker. The 35-year-old Frenchman had looked set to stay at the Spanish club for one more year after a 2022-23 season in which he struggled with injuries and missed out on France's World Cup campaign in Qatar due to another injury. However, an offer estimated by media to be worth more than 100 million euros ($107.05 million) from Saudi Arabia reportedly made him reconsider his future."
5-6	Karim Benzema has been crowned as the top-performing player in world football in 2022. The Real Madrid skipper was recognised as the best player in the world and collected the Ballon d’Or in Paris. France Football, which awards the coveted prize, recognised his outstanding year at a ceremony at which our club was well represented in an expedition headed up by president Florentino Pérez. Benzema saw off competition from Mané, De Bruyne and Lewandowski (in that order) in voting that involved 180 international journalists, who cast their votes on the basis of the achievements of each player during the 2021/22 season. Benzema collected the trophy from Zidane and commented: “It makes me proud to have this trophy in front of me. I remember when I was younger and all the hard work and training sessions. It was a dream I had as a child and I always had this award in my mind. I was motivated to win it because of two of my idols: Zidane and Ronaldo. It’s an award that every footballer has in mind. It’s very tough to win it, but not impossible. I don’t only think about scoring goals, but about having fun out on the pitch and helping my teammates.”

He has now been recognised as the world’s best by his peers, with competition from the likes of Mohamed Salah, Robert Lewandowski, Sadio Mane, Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland seen off to land the prestigious Golden Ball.
5-8	"`""We know we’re hard to beat at the Bernabéu and hope to make it to the final"", added Rodrygo. The battle for a place in the Champions League final will be decided next Wednesday at the Bernabéu. Karim Benzema, who bagged a brace at the Etihad Stadium, spoke about the team’s performance against Manchester City: “Losing a game is never good because we're excited about our chances of winning the Champions League. The most important thing is that we never gave in. We've now got to go back to the Bernabéu, where we’ll need the fans more than ever and we're going to win, which will be magical”. “If you go into a game without confidence, they’ll go and score two goals against you because they're a good side and they press you hard at home. We lacked a little bit of everything: ambition, pressing and confidence”."
5-9	Real Madrid and Karim Benzema produced another memorable night that will go down in European football history. Just when it seemed that all was lost after a first-half goal by Mbappé, the Bernabéu spurred on the players who responded with three quick-fire goals to send Madrid into the Champions League quarter-finals. Benzema scored all three goals, taking his tally to 30 for the season, to become the club’s third top goal-scorer in Real Madrid’s entire 120-year history, after overtaking Alfredo Di Stéfano. Carlo Ancelotti’s side knew they had to take risks and began by pressing high up the pitch. The Whites looked to win the ball back in the centre of midfield, but PSG posed a real threat on the counterattack, which is how the visitors carved out their best chances. The French team’s first two chances, on 8’ and 13’, were for Mbappé, who found himself one-on-one with Courtois, but the keeper stood tall to deny the striker. The hosts responded immediately when Benzema’s first-time curling strike from the edge of the area forced Donnarumma into a save in the 25th minute.
5-10	The forward is the sixth top scorer in the club's history with 240 goals. In his eleventh season at Real Madrid, Benzema played his 500th game for the Whites in the Clásico. The Frenchman reached this figure against Barcelona, the team he has faced the most times as a Real Madrid player together with Atletico (34). The president Florentino Pérez gave him a commemorative jersey after the match. His number of goals is spectacular. He has scored 240 times, which makes him one of the legends of the club and the sixth highest goal scorer ever. He is behind Cristiano Ronaldo (451), Raul (323), Di Stefano (308), Santillana (290) and Puskas (242). He is also, after Raúl and Santillana, the third centre forward to have played the most matches for Real Madrid. Florentino Perez gave him a commemorative jersey at the end of the Clásico
5-11	Report from the Champions League quarter-final first leg at Stamford Bridge as holders Chelsea left with mountain to climb as 13-time winners Real Madrid seize first-leg advantage thanks to Karim Benzema treble Chelsea must overturn a two-goal deficit at Real Madrid to salvage their Champions League defence after Karim Benzema's hat-trick secured a 3-1 quarter-final first-leg victory over the error-strewn holders at Stamford Bridge. Benzema dispatched two exquisite headers in three first-half minutes at a rain-drenched Stamford Bridge as Madrid set about avenging last season's semi-final defeat to Thomas Tuchel's reigning European champions in perfect fashion. Kai Havertz grabbed a lifeline for Chelsea before half-time, but it evaporated 46 seconds after the restart when Edouard Mendy vacated his area and played an under-hit pass to Antonio Rudiger, which put Benzema's hat-trick clinching goal on a plate.
5-12	Karim Benzema scored against Eintracht Frankfurt to become the second highest goalscorer in Real Madrid's history. The Frenchman has now hit 324 goals four our club, overtaking Raúl's 323 between 1994 and 2010. Now only Cristiano Ronaldo sits ahead of him on the list of madridista goalscorers, with 451. The forward was on target in the first official match of the 2022/23 season, carrying on where he left off from the previous campaign, during which he set a new scoring record (44 goals). Benzema opened his madridista account on matchday three of LaLiga 2009/10 against Xerez and has since gone on to win it all with Real Madrid. His incredible trophy haul comprises 21 titles: 4 Champions Leagues, 4 Club World Cups, 4 European Super Cups, 4 LaLigas, 2 Copas del Rey and 4 Spanish Super Cups. His 324 goals have come spread across six competitions: 219 in LaLiga, 74 in the Champions League, 21 in the Copa del Rey, 3 in the Club World Cup, 5 in the Spanish Super Cup and 2 in the European Super Cup. His favourite opposition as a madridista are Athletic (18), Valencia (15) and Granada (14).
5-13	Benzema leaves Real Madrid: Departure is officially confirmed by the club It has been officially confirmed by Real Madrid that Karim Benzema is leaving the club this summer, with the striker departing the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu after 14 seasons representing Los Blancos. This Sunday's home match against Athletic Club will be Benzema's final game for the club, as an era ends at Real Madrid. His exit follows those of Marco Asensio, Mariano and Eden Hazard, all of which were announced on Saturday.
5-14	Karim Benzema agrees Real Madrid exit after Cristiano Ronaldo proposal Karim Benzema is set to leave Real Madrid in the summer of 2024 after agreeing a fresh one-year contract extension with the club. The striker recently turned down a lucrative offer to move to Saudi Arabia as he opts to stay in European football. It was a similar approach that saw his former teammate Cristiano Ronaldo complete a stunning move to Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr in January, where he is earning in the region of £173million per year. Benzema remains a key player for the Spanish giants and was crowned as the Ballon d'Or winner last year, capping a wonderful individual year. His incredible run of form helped fire Los Blancos to domestic and European glory.
5-15	Karim Benzema could leave Real Madrid if Erling Braut Haaland joins the Spanish giants, according to a report The French international striker has contributed 17 goals and seven assists in 20 La Liga appearances this season, as Real look to regain the Spanish title. However, according to Catalan online news outlet El Nacional, the 34-year-old is considering leaving the capital after 13 years at the club following his move from Lyon back in 2009. The outlet reports that Benzema is unhappy with the repeated pursuits of both Kylian Mbappe and Dortmund striker Haaland, which would potentially leave the club legend with a bit-part role. With his contract expiring in the summer of 2023, Real president Florentino Perez has been keen to tie down the Frenchman's future until the end of his career, but to this point, Benzema has rejected those contract offers. The report continues with the interest of Paris Saint-Germain in Benzema's services, particularly if Zinedine Zidane were to take over in the French capital.
5-16	"Karim Benzema's agent has quelled speculation of a possible transfer to Arsenal, stating that the striker wants to remain at Real Madrid. Talking to the French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche, Benzema's agent, Karim Djaziri, said: ""We can not fight against the rumours, but I assure you Karim will not go to Arsenal. There has never been any discussions and no contact has been established."" There had been talk that the imminent arrival of Gareth Bale would push Benzema out of Madrid, but Djaziri confirmed his client is in discussions over a new contract. ""We are working on a contract extension for three years,"" he said. ""Discussions are taking place quietly, without deadline. Karim could well end his career at Real, the club of his dreams."""
5-17	Nassr captain, Cristiano Ronaldo has said that he would like to own a football club in the future. Ronaldo also said that he knew Karim Benzema would leave Real Madrid for the Saudi league, adding that several other players are coming to the Middle East. Speaking at the launch of his water brand ‘Ursu’, Ronaldo was asked about his plans for the future and the former Manchester United forward said, (as per CristianoXtra). “In the future, I would like to own a club, I don’t rule it out.” When quizzed about the Saudi league, the Portugal international added: “I knew that Benzema is coming to Saudi, and that is why I said that the Saudi league will be among the top 5 in the future, more players will come.”
5-18	Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has decided to depart Real Madrid after 14 years at the club, according to multiple reports. The French forward will go down as one of the  greatest ever to do it in a Real Madrid shirt, securing 25 trophies across his career at the Santiago Bernabeu. Five of those were Champions League trophies, amongst four La Liga titles and three Copas del Rey too. During his time at Real Madrid, Benzema has racked up 647 appearances, scoring 353 goals, and providing 165, culminating in a Ballon d’Or last season. His 2021-22 campaign will go down as one of the best ever, securing the La Liga title and one of the most dramatic ever Champions League victories.
5-19	"Real Madrid beat Sevilla 3-1 in a Spanish La Liga match Saturday as French star Karim Benzema brought his Ballon d'Or trophy to the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium to celebrate with fans. Benzema did not play in the match as Real Madrid confirmed he was diagnosed with ""muscular fatigue in the quadricep muscle of his left leg."" The Frenchman won the 2022 men’s version of the coveted award Monday after completing a scintillating 2021-22 season for Real Madrid. He scored 44 goals in 46 games as the Whites clinched the La Liga and the UEFA Champions League trophies. He also won the UEFA Super Cup in August. Before the Sevilla match, Benzema lifted his trophy as the best player in the world into the air to cheering fans."
6-0	Perfection can come in many forms and be interpreted in different ways. Manchester City has produced more polished performances under Pep Guardiola this season. There have been matches where the team has scored more and created more – yet City’s ability to dominate its opponent, to do enough to win when it matters is as perfect as it gets on a soccer pitch. It is why this team continues to chase history this season. As the 2-1 scoreline would suggest, this FA Cup match between bitter rivals City and Manchester United was a tense affair. A victory for the blue side of Manchester was never a foregone conclusion. United had opportunities, yet City had the composure, the know-how, the class. Two goals from captain İlkay Gündoğan – the first 12 seconds after kick off for the quickest in FA Cup history – secured a win which gave City its second trophy of the season and maintained the team’s quest to win the ‘treble’ of the Premier League, the FA Cup and the Champions League.
6-1	The Premier League calendar for the 2022/23 season will be confirmed soon and other football dates for the upcoming 12 months are in the diary. The Premier League fixture list will be released at 9am tomorrow, Thursday 16 June. Dates for the Emirates FA Cup are also now set. The FA Cup will start on the same day as the Premier League - Saturday 6 August - with the Extra Preliminary Round. Brentford will enter at the Third Round Proper stage at the start of 2023. The FA Cup Final will be held in June 2023. The schedule for 2022/23 is affected by the 2022 FIFA World Cup, being held in Qatar at the end of year. This means the FA Cup schedule is a little different. Confirmed round dates are below.
6-2	Manchester United will be playing Manchester City at the iconic Wembley Stadium in London on Saturday in the FA Cup final. Pep Guardiola's Man City are aiming to become only second English club to win historic treble - Premier League, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League. City have already bagged Premier League title, and are in finals of both FA Cup and UEFA Champions League. Interestingly, Manchester United are the only English club so far to achieve the historic feat of winning the treble in 1999. Erik ten Hag's club would like to win FA Cup 2023 to add to its domestic cup tally as it lifted EFL Cup earlier this year.
6-3	Manchester United beat Brighton & Hove Albion in a thrilling penalty shootout after their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Sunday finished 0-0 after extra time to set up the first all-Manchester clash in the final. Solly March, Brighton's seventh player to step up to the spot in the shootout, launched the ball over the bar, before Victor Lindelof found the net to secure a 7-6 shootout victory for United.
6-4	Chelsea and Manchester United will face off in front of a sold-out Wembley Stadium on 14 May for the football's 2022/23 Women’s FA Cup final. The Blues will look to secure a third consecutive Women’s FA Cup, whilst their opponents Manchester United prepare to play in their first-ever domestic final. Both sides head into the fixture in great form, with Manchester United currently four points clear at the top of the Women’s Super League. Chelsea, however, find themselves in second with two games in hand over the Red Devils. Chelsea have already missed out on two lots of silverware this season - losing to Arsenal in the Conti Cup final and Barcelona in the semi-finals of the Women’s Champions League. Manchester United have, so far, had their best season to date. The Red Devils have lost only twice in the league, both times to FA Cup final opposition, Chelsea.
6-5	Manchester City’s mission to win a treble of major trophies stayed on track after beating Manchester United 2-1 in the FA Cup final, with the first of Ilkay Gundogan’s two goals coming after just a record 13 seconds. With City having already retained the Premier League, now only a first-ever Champions League title stands between Pep Guardiola’s team and immortality in English football. Gundogan, City’s captain, scored the quickest goal in an FA Cup final on Saturday – timed by British broadcaster BBC at 12.91 seconds – only for United midfielder Bruno Fernandes to convert a 33rd-minute penalty against the run of play after Jack Grealish was adjudged to have handled the ball. If Gundogan’s opener was probably his best goal for City, his 51st-minute winning goal might be one of his scrappiest as he met a cross from Kevin De Bruyne from a free kick with a left-foot volley that bobbled between two United defenders and past goalkeeper David de Gea.
6-6	Manchester City have won their first-ever Champions League and a treble after a 1-0 win over Inter Milan. Midfielder Rodri scored from 15 yards out in the 68th minute to secure a victory over the Italian side at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul - capping an unforgettable season for Pep Guardiola's side. They outpaced closest rivals Arsenal to comfortably win the Premier League, and last week beat fierce rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup final.
6-7	Manchester City remain on course for the Treble after Ilkay Gundogan scored twice to give them victory over Manchester United in the FA Cup final at Wembley. Having already won the Premier League title, City now go into next Saturday's Champions League final against Inter Milan in Istanbul with the opportunity to emulate United's feat of 1999. And City captain Gundogan was the big game match-winner again, assuring his place in history with the quickest goal in FA Cup final history, a stunning volley after only 12 seconds eclipsing Louis Saha's strike for Everton after 25 seconds against Chelsea in 2009. Manchester United equalised after 33 minutes when the video assistant referee ruled that Jack Grealish had handled, Bruno Fernandes coolly sending Stefan Ortega the wrong way from the spot. It was Gundogan, as he does so often, who made the decisive contribution when he volleyed Kevin de Bruyne's free-kick past United keeper David de Gea six minutes after the break to give City the FA Cup for the seventh time.

6-9	Manchester United and Manchester City will face each other in the FA Cup 2022-23 final at Wembley Stadium in London on Saturday. The football teams from Manchester are two of the most successful clubs in the FA Cup, with Manchester United lifting the title 12 times and City winning on six occasions. Currently under coach Pep Guardiola, Manchester City last won the FA Cup in 2019 while the Red Devils lifted the trophy in 2016. The upcoming match will be the first major final between the two clubs. The Manchester City vs Manchester United FA Cup 2023 final will be live streamed in India. Manchester City are chasing a treble this season, having already won the Premier League. They also have a chance to clinch the UEFA Champions League against Inter Milan next week. Manchester United, coached by Eric Ten Hag, have also added some silverware this season by winning the Carabao Cup in February.
6-10	Manchester United players are reportedly uninformed about David de Gea's future at the club and are unsure he will stay following his FA Cup final blunder. According to Manchester Evening News, several of the higher-ups at Old Trafford are ready to move on from De Gea. The Spaniard's contract with the Red Devils has entered its final week.
6-11	Manchester City's Ilkay Gundogan scored the fastest goal in FA Cup final history to put his side ahead after 12 seconds against Manchester United at Wembley on Saturday. City captain Gundogan thumped an unstoppable volley past David de Gea after Erling Haaland flicked on a goal kick. The previous record was held by Louis Saha who scored after 25 seconds for Everton in the 2009 Cup final against Chelsea.
6-12	"A man has admitted wearing a Manchester United football shirt at Wembley Stadium which made an offensive reference to the Hillsborough disaster. James White, 33, from Warwickshire, pleaded guilty to displaying threatening or abusive writing likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. The judge at Willesden Magistrates' Court said it was ""abhorrent"". The court heard he had worn a shirt with 97 and the words ""Not Enough"" on the back at the FA Cup Final on 3 June. District Judge Mark Jabbitt said: ""It is hard to imagine a more... offensive reference to the 1989 Hillsborough disaster."" The judge added the shirt which White wore bore a ""hateful expression"" - calling it an ""abhorrent message"" - and that the impact of his actions are ""profound and distressing"". Ninety-seven football fans died as a result of a crush at a match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield on 15 April 1989."
6-13	Manchester City Lift FA Cup To Become 13th Team To Win English Double ROBERT SUMMERSCALESJUN 3, 2023 11:59 AM EDT Pep Guardiola's Manchester City class of 2023 have become the 13th team to win the FA Cup and be crowned league champions of England in the same season. City, who finished five points ahead of Arsenal in the Premier League, beat Manchester United 2-1 at Wembley in Saturday's FA Cup final. Ilkay Gundogan scored two goals from spectacular volleys for City, either side of a Bruno Fernandes penalty for United.
6-14	Liverpool beat Chelsea to go joint-third on the list of the FA Cup’s most successful clubs last year, as Kostas Tsimikas’ decisive penalty saw the Reds win the tournament for the eighth time in their history. After a goalless Wembley final went to penalties, Mason Mount’s spot-kick miss for Chelsea proved crucial, allowing Tsimikas to secure a 6-5 shootout win for Jürgen Klopp’s men. Klopp is the first ever German coach to win the FA Cup.
6-15	Winning trophies is all coaches, players, and fans want since that is what soccer is all about. Some teams have sealed their names in history books by winning three major trophies in a single season and are called the treble winners. So, what is a treble in football, and how many teams have ever achieved it? What is a treble in football Manchester City's players celebrate on stage with their trophies following an open-top bus victory parade for their European Cup, FA Cup and Premier League victories in Manchester, northern England on 12 June 2023.

6-16	"June 19 (Reuters) - A fan who wore an offensive football shirt referencing the Hillsborough disaster to the FA Cup final has been banned from attending football games for four years on Monday, Willesden Magistrates' Court in London said. James White, 33, admitted wearing the shirt with the number 97 and ""not enough"" at Wembley Stadium on June 3, referring to the 97 fans who died during the 1989 FA Cup semi-final in a crush at the over-crowded Hillsborough Stadium."
6-17	Manchester United have issued an indefinite ban from matches to the man who wore a shirt with an offensive reference to the Hillsborough disaster to the FA Cup final. James White, 33, of Warwickshire, who was also fined £1,000, pled guilty on Monday morning to the charge of displaying threatening or abusive writing likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. Willesden Magistrates’ Court in London heard White wore a Manchester United shirt with the number 97 and the phrase “Not Enough” on it to the final on June 3. It was a reference to the Hillsborough disaster. There was a crush at a match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April, 1989 at Hillsborough Stadium, resulting in the death of 97 football fans. An inquest jury ruled in 2016 that they were unlawfully killed amid a number of police errors. White was arrested during the game and charged the day after. A United statement read: “Manchester United today issued an indefinite club ban to James White who pleaded guilty to charges at Willesden Magistrates Court.
6-18	The 2023 FA Cup final is all set to take place on June 3 and it will see a clash of the titans, with Manchester City taking on Manchester United. For the uninitiated, the FA Cup, which is also known as the Football Association Challenge Cup, is an annual knockout competition in England which holds the unique distinction of being the oldest national football competition in the world. Its first iteration took place in…. wait for it… the 1871-1872 season.
6-19	Manchester City secured a historic Treble last season, with Pep Guardiola's side now preparing for the new campaign. Guardiola's men will play in this year's Community Shield, which is seen as the curtain-raiser before the new Premier League season. Fixtures for the 2023-24 campaign has already been released. City secured their third league title in a row in May, defeated rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup final and won their first-ever Champions League trophy when they beat Inter Milan in Istanbul. With that being said, the side has struggled in the Community Shield over the last two years. They were beaten by Leicester in 2021 and then lost to Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool last season. With the Community Shield around the corner, when will the game take place? Who will Man City play? Mail Sport provides the answers below.
7-0	We’ve been an AI-first company since 2016, because we see AI as the most significant way to deliver on our mission. Since then, we’ve used AI to improve many of our core products, from Search, YouTube and Gmail to the incredible camera in Pixel phones. We’ve helped businesses and developers harness the power of AI via Google Cloud, and we’ve shown AI’s potential to address societal issues like health and climate change. Along the way, we’ve been lucky to have two world-class research teams leading the entire industry forward with foundational breakthroughs that have ushered in a new era of AI. The pace of progress is now faster than ever before. To ensure the bold and responsible development of general AI, we’re creating a unit that will help us build more capable systems more safely and responsibly. This group, called Google DeepMind, will bring together two leading research groups in the AI field: the Brain team from Google Research, and DeepMind. Their collective accomplishments in AI over the last decade span AlphaGo, Transformers, word2vec, WaveNet, AlphaFold, sequence to sequence models, distillation, deep reinforcement learning, and distributed systems and software frameworks like TensorFlow and JAX for expressing, training and deploying large scale ML models. Combining all this talent into one focused team, backed by the computational resources of Google, will significantly accelerate our progress in AI. As CEO of Google DeepMind, Demis Hassabis will lead the development of our most capable and responsible general AI systems — research that will help power the next generation of our products and services. Jeff Dean will take on the elevated role of Google’s Chief Scientist, reporting to me. In that capacity he’ll serve as Chief Scientist to Google Research and Google DeepMind. Working alongside Demis, Jeff will help set the future direction of our AI research and head up our most critical and strategic technical projects related to AI, the first of which will be a series of powerful, multimodal AI models. Google Research will continue its important work leading fundamental advances in computer science across areas such as algorithms and theory, privacy and security, quantum computing, health, climate and sustainability and responsible AI, and will report in to James Manyika along with his existing Tech & Society teams. I’m so excited for the next phase of this journey, the progress we’ll make against our mission, and all the ways we’ll help people reach their potential with increasingly capable and responsible AI.
7-1	Alphabet is merging an internal Google Research team called Brain with DeepMind, a move designed to bring two groups focused on artificial intelligence closer together as the battle for AI heats up. Google acquired DeepMind in 2014 for a reported $500 million and has until now run it as an independent unit out of the U.K. DeepMind has been one of Alphabet’s “other bets,” performing futuristic work, such as teaching computer systems to beat top-ranked players of the Chinese board game Go.
7-2	DeepMind, the artificial intelligence company acquired by Alphabet in 2014, is merging with Google’s Brain team to form Google DeepMind. In a post shared by Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, he says the combined groups will “significantly accelerate our progress in AI.” DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis will serve as the CEO of Google DeepMind, where Pichai says he will “lead the development of our most capable and responsible general AI systems.” Meanwhile, Jeff Dean, Google’s former senior vice president of Google Research and Health who co-founded the Brain team, will take on the role of Google Research and Google DeepMind’s chief scientist.
7-3	Google Brain was a deep learning artificial intelligence research team under the umbrella of Google AI, a research division at Google dedicated to artificial intelligence. Formed in 2011, Google Brain combines open-ended machine learning research with information systems and large-scale computing resources.[1] The team has created tools such as TensorFlow, which allow for neural networks to be used by the public, with multiple internal AI research projects.[2] The team aims to create research opportunities in machine learning and natural language processing.[2] The team was merged into former Google sister company DeepMind to form Google DeepMind in April 2023.
7-4	The Google Brain project began in 2011 as a part-time research collaboration between Google fellow Jeff Dean, Google Researcher Greg Corrado, and Stanford University professor Andrew Ng.[3] Ng had been interested in using deep learning techniques to crack the problem of artificial intelligence since 2006, and in 2011 began collaborating with Dean and Corrado to build a large-scale deep learning software system, DistBelief,[4] on top of Google's cloud computing infrastructure. Google Brain started as a Google X project and became so successful that it was graduated back to Google: Astro Teller has said that Google Brain paid for the entire cost of Google X.[5]
7-5	"How Google Brain Began The human brain is likely the most complex creation—an intricate biological machine with many areas simultaneously performing different tasks. However, AI developers aim to make AI systems perform complex operations and solve problems like humans. MAKEUSEOF VIDEO OF THE DAY In 2011, Andrew Ng, a college professor, Jeff Dean, a Google fellow, and Greg Corrado, a Google Researcher, established Google Brain as a research team for exploring AI. Initially, the team didn't have an official name; after Ng joined Google X, he began collaborating with Dean and Corrado to integrate deep learning processes into Google's existing infrastructure. Eventually, the team became a part of Google Research and was called ""Google Brain."" The founding Brain team members sought to create intelligence that could independently learn from large amounts of data. They also aimed to address existing AI networks' challenges, including language understanding, speech, and image recognition. In 2012, Google Brain encountered a breakthrough. The researchers fed millions of images obtained from YouTube into the neural network to train it on pattern recognition without prior information. After the experiment, the network recognized cats with a high degree of accuracy. This breakthrough paved the way for a wide range of applications."
7-6	Google Brain, which began in 2011, by Jeff Dean, Greg Corrado, and Andrew Ng is an Artificial Intelligence system based on open learning that has been capturing headlines all over the world. Only a year after being fully developed, i.e., in 2012, it trained itself to identify the image of a cat based on 10 million images – an event that grabbed headlines and popped eyeballs and as a consequence found a place in the New York Times. Quite evidently, Google Brain then combines open-ended Machine Learning with the vast prowess of Google’s computing resources. Google Brain, as the name suggests, is meant to replicate, as closely as possible, the functioning of a normal human brain. And the team behind it has been largely successful in doing the same. In October 2016, the people behind the Brain tried to conduct a basic simulation of human communication between three AIs: Alice, Bob and Eve. The purpose was to have Alice and Bob communicate effectively – without Bob misreading Alice’s messages and without Eve intercepting them or with Bob and Alice carrying out proper encryption and decryption, on their respective parts. The study showed that for every round where they failed to communicate properly, the next round showed a significant improvement in the cryptographic abilities of the two AIs.
7-7	AlphaGo is a computer program that plays the board game Go.[1] It was developed by the London-based DeepMind Technologies,[2] an acquired subsidiary of Google (now Alphabet Inc.). Subsequent versions of AlphaGo became increasingly powerful, including a version that competed under the name Master.[3] After retiring from competitive play, AlphaGo Master was succeeded by an even more powerful version known as AlphaGo Zero, which was completely self-taught without learning from human games. AlphaGo Zero was then generalized into a program known as AlphaZero, which played additional games, including chess and shogi. AlphaZero has in turn been succeeded by a program known as MuZero which learns without being taught the rules.
7-8	AlphaFold is an artificial intelligence (AI) program developed by DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet, which performs predictions of protein structure.[1] The program is designed as a deep learning system.[2] AlphaFold AI software has had two major versions. A team of researchers that used AlphaFold 1 (2018) placed first in the overall rankings of the 13th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) in December 2018. The program was particularly successful at predicting the most accurate structure for targets rated as the most difficult by the competition organisers, where no existing template structures were available from proteins with a partially similar sequence. A team that used AlphaFold 2 (2020) repeated the placement in the CASP competition in November 2020.[3] The team achieved a level of accuracy much higher than any other group.[2][4] It scored above 90 for around two-thirds of the proteins in CASP's global distance test (GDT), a test that measures the degree to which a computational program predicted structure is similar to the lab experiment determined structure, with 100 being a complete match, within the distance cutoff used for calculating GDT.
7-9	Firstly, we’ll discuss the founders and history. Secondly, we will discuss a few research areas the google brain team work on, then discuss the difference between Google Brain & DeepMind, and finally future opportunities the brain team are looking forward to. Google Brain, formed in 2011, is a deep learning artificial intelligence research team inside Google AI, the company’s artificial intelligence research division. Open-ended machine learning research is combined with information systems and large-scale computer resources and tools in Google Brain. Multiple internal AI research initiatives employ tools like tensor flow, which allow the public to explore neural networks. The Google Brain project began in 2011 as a part-time research collaboration between Google fellow Jeff Dean, Google Researcher Greg Corrado, and Stanford University professor Andrew Ng. Google Brain started as a Google X project and became so successful that it was graduated back to Google:
7-10	For those who are wondering, Google Brain & DeepMind are not the same. Google Brain is the original AI research effort within Google that started in 2011. It used to be the principal AI research effort within Google. Then came along DeepMind. DeepMind was a British AI startup acquired by Google in 2014. Both Google Brain & DeepMind are research labs, however, Google Brain has a strong application focus, working and publishing papers, in many areas, while DeepMind focus is on reinforcement learning where they have flagship efforts such as AlphaGo Zero which is spearheading efforts to achieve Artificial General Intelligence.
7-11	Google Brain is the original AI research effort within Google that started in 2011 as collaborative effort between Google Fellow Jeff Dean, Google researtcher Greg Corrado and Stanford professor Andrew Ng. It used to be the principal AI research effort within Google. Then came along DeepMind, as a flagship British AI startup acquired by Google in 2014. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that it was setup as an internal competitor within Google, aimed at improving the quality of the work of the both groups by competing against each other. It was also important that the bidding for DeepMind was competitive, with Google snatching it away from Facebook, so DeepMind had the luxury of dictating terms of the acquisition and the degree of their independence.
7-12	The origin of it is that Google Brain was started as an internal google project, and is lead by Jeff Dean - I think it’s always been this way. It works on a mix of applied projects and research projects, and has emphasized researcher freedom for a while, but I don’t know if it still does. Deepmind was an independent startup that google bought. They’re famous for the idea of applying ML to learning to play video games - which was not popular at all until they started doing it. They also pushed hard on combining Reinforcement Learning with Deep Learning. Deepmind also has a reputation for being more centralized.
7-13	For the past several years, we’ve pursued research that reflects our commitment to make AI available for everyone. From computer vision to healthcare research to AutoML, we have increasingly put emphasis on implementing machine learning techniques in nearly everything we do at Google. Our research has been core to the development and integration of these systems into Google products and platforms. To better reflect this commitment, we’re unifying our efforts under “Google AI”, which encompasses all the state-of-the-art research happening across Google. As part of this, we have expanded the Google AI website, and are renaming our existing Google Research channels, including this blog and the affiliated Twitter and Google+ channels, to Google AI. And if you’re looking for information that existed on research.google.com or the affiliated social channels, don’t fret, it’s all still there. Any links to previous Google Research website content, blog posts or tweets will redirect appropriately. The Google AI channels will continue to showcase the breadth of Google research, innovation and publications, in addition to a lot more new and exciting content to come. We encourage you to explore! We look forward to continuing to bring you the latest updates and results from Google, in AI and across many other areas of research.
7-14	DeepMind, one of the world’s premier artificial intelligence labs, has turned a profit for the first time ever, according to a filing with the U.K. company registry published Tuesday. The London-based research firm recorded a profit of £43.8 million ($59.6 million) in 2020 after posting losses of hundreds of millions for the last several years. It reported a loss of $649 million in 2019, for example. Turnover at DeepMind more than tripled from just £265.5 million in 2019 to £826.2 million in 2020, according to the annual results filing on Companies House. DeepMind, which is owned by Google parent Alphabet , did not provide a specific reason for the revenue jump.
7-15	DeepMind, the London-based artificial intelligence research company that is owned by Google-parent Alphabet, is spinning off a new, for-profit Alphabet venture dedicated to drug discovery. The new company, called Isomorphic Laboratories, will be based in the U.K. and be led “in its initial phase” by Demis Hassabis, DeepMind’s co-founder and chief executive, according to a blog post Hassabis authored. He said he would continue to serve as DeepMind’s CEO as well. The company will build on an A.I. technology pioneered by DeepMind, called AlphaFold, that can predict the structure of proteins. This information is one important piece in the design of many new drugs. DeepMind’s ability to accurately predict protein shapes based only on genetic sequences for those proteins solved a 50-year-old challenge in computational biology.
7-16	Hi Team When we launched DeepMind back in 2010, many people thought general AI was a farfetched science fiction technology that was decades away from being a reality. Now, we live in a time in which AI research and technology is advancing exponentially. In the coming years, AI - and ultimately AGI - has the potential to drive one of the greatest social, economic and scientific transformations in history. That’s why today Sundar is announcing that DeepMind and the Brain team from Google Research will be joining forces as a single, focused unit called Google DeepMind. Combining our talents and efforts will accelerate our progress towards a world in which AI helps solve the biggest challenges facing humanity, and I’m incredibly excited to be leading this unit and working with all of you to build it. Together, in close collaboration with our fantastic colleagues across the Google Product Areas, we have a real opportunity to deliver AI research and products that dramatically improve the lives of billions of people, transform industries, advance science, and serve diverse communities.

The shake-up will leave Demis Hassabis, the British head of DeepMind, in charge of an expanded group that can lay claim to many of the research breakthroughs that have turned AI into the industry’s most important new technology since the arrival of the internet. He will also take on a more direct role in developing advanced AI systems that are central to Google’s future business, after nine years working on areas of advanced research that seldom related directly to the internet company’s operations. The move to focus Alphabet’s most advanced research more directly on AI models with a direct application to Google’s internet business follows the breakout success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which has presented the biggest challenge to Google’s internet search business since Microsoft mounted an unsuccessful challenge two decades ago.
7-18	Google has officially unveiled its own version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Called Bard, the chatbot is built off the company’s LaMDA large language model, whose conversational capabilities impressed a former Google engineer so much he thought it was sentient. A “lightweight” version of Bard chatbot is now available to “trusted testers” and will be more widely available to the public in “coming weeks,” said Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai in a blog post. Bard is designed similarly to ChatGPT, both in functionality but also in looks: appearing as a dialogue box where users type in their queries.
7-19	Google is to make its chatbot technology available to the public in “the coming weeks and months” as it responds to the success of ChatGPT, a Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence chatbot that has become a global phenomenon after it was made available free of charge. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google’s owner, Alphabet, said the use of AI had reached an “inflection point” and the company was “extremely well positioned” in the field. Pichai referred to two so-called large language models developed by the company, LaMDA and PaLM, with the former set to be released soon. This week CNBC reported that Google had begun testing an AI chatbot similar to ChatGPT called Apprentice Bard, which uses LaMDA technology. LaMDA shot to prominence last year when Google suspended and then dismissed an engineer after he went public with claims that LaMDA was “sentient”. Google said Blake Lemoine’s claims about LaMDA – an acronym for language model for dialogue applications – were “wholly unfounded”.

8-6	Jennie from massively popular K-pop girl group Blackpink left a concert early in Melbourne, Australia on June 11, 2023, so fans immediately began wondering why she had to exit. An idol leaving a concert early is unusual, but it also isn’t wildly rare. For one reason or another, there are unfortunately many documented cases of idols not making it through a whole concert, especially during international tours. Sometimes, exhaustion just catches up with a person. But here is the formal explanation YG Entertainment had to offer on the subject. YG Explains Why Jennie Left the Blackpink Melbourne Concert Early on June 11 YG said that Jennie couldn’t finish the concert owing to “deteriorating condition,” a common way for companies to phrase that an idol just wasn’t feeling well. It didn’t elaborate on the nature of her illness, but if no further information is disclosed, then we can presume this was another general case of exhaustion. Blackpink has been doing the Born Pink World Tour since October 2022, and it is scheduled to finish this August. It makes sense that the group members would experience fatigue with a schedule like this, especially since lengthy tours with significant travel aren’t a phenomenon that K-pop idols are as used to as popular musicians in, for example, the United States.

9-1	G7 summit, Hiroshima, Japan, 19-21 May 2023 Family photo at the Shrine Family photo at the Shrine Main results The G7 summit hosted by this year's Japanese G7 presidency took place in Hiroshima City, Japan. We, the leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), met in Hiroshima (…), more united than ever in our determination to meet the global challenges of this moment and set the course for a better future. G7 leaders' communiqué The main issues addressed during the nine working sessions were: Russia's aggression against Ukraine nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation global economy, finance and sustainable development climate change, energy and environment food security and health engagement with international partners A leaders' communiqué was adopted at the end of the summit.
9-2	Since President Biden took office, revitalizing our alliances and partnerships and reestablishing America’s leadership around the world has been one of his top priorities. The G7 Summit in Hiroshima showed that the G7 are more united than ever: united on Ukraine, united on China, united on economic security, united on building the clean energy economies of the future, united on nuclear disarmament, and united on fighting poverty and responding to global challenges like the climate crisis around the world. United on Ukraine G7 Leaders set forth a powerful statement of unity strength and commitment in our response to Russia’s war of aggression. Leaders announced a set of concrete actions to intensify the G7’s diplomatic, financial, humanitarian and security support for Ukraine, to increase the costs to Russia and those supporting its war efforts, and to continue to counter the negative impacts of Russia’s war on the rest of the world, particularly on the most vulnerable people.
9-3	"The Group of Seven (G7) is an intergovernmental political forum consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States; additionally, the European Union (EU) is a ""non-enumerated member."" It is organized around shared values of pluralism, liberal democracy, and representative government.[1][2][3] As of 2020, G7 members are large IMF advanced economies and account for over half of global net wealth (at over $200 trillion),[4] 30 to 43 percent of global gross domestic product,[n 1] and 10 percent of the world's population (770 million people).[5] Some members are great powers in global affairs and maintain mutually close political, economic, diplomatic, and military relations. Originating from an ad hoc gathering of finance ministers in 1973, the G7 has since become a formal, high-profile venue for discussing and coordinating solutions to major global issues, especially in the areas of trade, security, economics, and climate change.[6] Each member's head of government or state, along with the EU's Commission President and Council President, meet annually at the G7 Summit; other high-ranking officials of the G7 and the EU meet throughout the year. Representatives of other states and international organizations are often invited as guests, with Russia having been a formal member (as part of the Group of Eight) from 1997 to 2014."
9-4	Summary The G7 is an informal grouping of advanced democracies that meets annually to coordinate global economic policy and address other transnational issues. Russia’s membership was suspended in 2014 over the annexation of Crimea. Due to internal divisions and the rise of alternative institutions such as the G20, some experts have questioned the G7’s relevance. Introduction The G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies—the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom (UK)—that meets annually to discuss issues such as global economic governance, international security, and energy policy. Proponents say the forum’s small and relatively homogenous membership promotes collective decision-making, but critics note that it often lacks follow-through and excludes important emerging powers.
9-5	Role of the G7 The G7, originally G8, originated in 1973 and was set up in 1975 as an informal forum bringing together the heads of government and ministers of the world’s leading industrial nations. The annual G7 summits have over the years developed into a platform for determining the course of multilateral discourse and shaping political responses to global challenges. It complements the role of the G20, which is widely regarded as the framework for ongoing global economic coordination. In 1977, representatives of the then European Community began participating in the London summit. The role has expanded over time, with the EU gradually included in all political discussions on the summit agenda and, from the Ottawa summit (1981) onwards, has taken part in all working sessions. The European Union is a unique supranational organisation – rather than a sovereign Member State – hence the name G7 “Group of Seven”. The EU is therefore a “non-enumerated” member and does not assume the rotating G7 presidency. The summit gathers leaders from the European Union and the following countries: Canada France Germany Italy Japan the United Kingdom the United States. It is capable of setting the global agenda because decisions taken by these major economic powers have a real impact. The political direction set by these leaders on a policy issue will have a “ripple” effect across many other international organisations and institutions. Thus, decisions taken at the G7 are not legally binding, but exert strong political influence.
9-6	How does the G7 work? The G7 is a forum for dialogue at the highest level attended by the leaders of the world’s most important industrially advanced democracies. Its chief features are the intergovernmental nature of the preparatory process and its informality, which makes it easier for the leaders to discuss the world’s major issues and to rapidly devise and agree on solutions to them. Given that it is not an international organization, it is devoid of any kind of administrative structure or permanent secretariat. The Presidency The Presidency is held by each of the member countries in turn, in the following order: France, United States, Great Britain, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada. The European Union attends the G7 but neither chairs nor hosts Summits.
9-7	"The Group of Seven nations have confirmed their unity and readiness to back Ukraine, and also agreed to coordinate policies in relations with China. That’s according to a statement by the spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State, Matthew Miller, commenting on the meeting of Secretary Antony Blinken with his G7 counterparts on the sidelines of the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London, an Ukrinform correspondent reports. ""They (meeting participants - ed.) underscored their continued support for Ukraine in responding to Russia's brutal war of aggression,"" the statement says. Read also: Britain would be very supportive of plan that could simplify Ukraine's path to NATO – Cleverly Meeting with representatives of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Great Britain, and the European Union, Blnken also briefed partners on the talks with Chinese leaders during his recent trip to Beijing. ""The G7 noted the importance of close coordination on the PRC and reaffirmed that the G7 is more united than ever,"" the State Department spokesman added."
9-8	Western microchips and other components coming largely via China are being used to manufacture Russian cruise and ballistic missiles that are being launched at Ukraine, Kyiv has said in a presentation prepared for G7 members this week. The document, leaked to the Guardian, calls for the world’s leading economies to “pressure countries who fail to act decisively”, without naming Beijing directly, as well as a plea to further tighten export controls. Russia, Kyiv says, “has adapted to sanctions” and will produce 1,061 missiles this year, more than double the 512 that the country’s arms manufacturers made in 2022, the first year of its full invasion of Ukraine. The document argues that with the help of China and others, western components have been found in Kh-101 and Kalibr cruise missiles as well as Iskander and the Kinzhal hypersonic ballistic missiles.

Today, hopes of a co-operative global economic order, which reached their zenith at the G20’s London summit of April 2009, have evaporated. Yet it is hardly a case of “Goodbye G20, hello G7”. The earlier world of G7 domination is even more remote than that of G20 co-operation. Neither global co-operation nor western domination look feasible. What might follow? Alas, “division” might be one answer and “anarchy” another. That is not what the communiqué from the meeting of G7 heads of government in Hiroshima suggests. It is breathtakingly comprehensive. It covers: Ukraine; disarmament and non-proliferation; the Indo-Pacific region; the global economy; climate change; the environment; energy, including clean energy; economic resilience and economic security; trade; food security; health; labour; education; digital; science and technology; gender; human rights, refugees, migration and democracy; terrorism, violent extremism and transnational organised crime; and relations with China, Afghanistan and Iran (among other countries).
9-10	"Household debt in Canada is now the highest of any G7 country, according to data by the country's housing agency. The amount owed by Canadian households is also higher than the country's entire GDP. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation said high home prices are to blame for the ballooning debt. Household debt in the US and the UK, by comparison, has shrunk in the last 10 years. In a report released on Tuesday, Canada's housing agency has warned that Canadians would not be able to weather a recession because of the high amount of debt they owe. ""Unfortunately, Canada's very high levels of household debt - and the highest in the G7 - makes the economy vulnerable to any global economic crisis,"" said Aled ab Iorwerth, the agency's deputy chief economist. In his report, Mr ab Iorwerth said that 75% of Canada's household debt comes from mortgages. As home prices increase in Canada, the household debt in Canada rises as well."
9-11	"Suspected Chinese APT groups exploited a 17-year-old Microsoft Office vulnerability in May to launch malware attacks against foreign government officials who attended a G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan. See Also: OnDemand Webinar | Learn Why CISOs Are Embracing These Top ASM Use Cases Now Threat actors targeted government officials from France, the United Kingdom, India, Singapore and Australia who attended a session on global food security, where they also discussed issues specific to the Chinese military and economic policies. Cybersecurity company SentinelOne reported that it had observed Chinese APT groups masquerading as Indonesia's Ministry of External Affairs and Department of Economic Affairs in emails sent to foreign government officials. The emails contained a malicious rich text format file named ""Hiroshima Action Statement for Resilient Global Food Security"" to lure the officials into downloading the attachment. The malicious emails appeared to be genuine. They appeared to have been sent by a government agency and the document's wording matched that of the action statement released on May 20 by G7 countries. China on May 20 severely criticized statements issued by G7 nations at the Hiroshima Summit, stating that the G7 group is hindering international peace, undermining regional stability and curbing other countries' development."
9-12	Japan, as chair of the G7 for the year 2023, hosted its annual leaders' summit from May 19- 21. It was held in Hiroshima, one of only two cities ever to suffer through the atomic bombing. Meanwhile, invited leaders made statements about world peace against the backdrop of the Genbaku Dome (Atomic Bomb Dome). JAPAN Forward wanted to know the younger generation's thoughts on the summit. For this article, six students from different countries were interviewed. All six are studying at Akita International University in Akita Prefecture. The answers they shared were astonishing. In this three-part series, their pessimistic views on nuclear disarmament, their skepticism of G7's initiatives, and their exceptional interest in Taiwan over Ukraine were revealed. Their answers hold importance as this young generation includes possible leaders in the coming era. Indeed, three out of the six interviewees want to be diplomats in the future.
9-13	If the G7 were a dinner party, the host would be rummaging in the garage for the extendable table, hunting through boxes for extra placemats and cutlery. This year's host, Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, has invited eight more guests to the summit, which starts on Friday in Hiroshima. It is certainly a sign of the thorny agenda that ranges from the war in Ukraine to how much food reaches our own dinner plates. And it is also evidence of a rapidly changing international order, with much of the conversation focusing on two countries that are not on the guest list: Russia and China. The annual gathering includes the world's seven wealthiest democracies - Japan, the United States, the UK, France, Germany, Canada and Italy. The European Union, although not an official G7 member, also dispatches representatives. More recently, hosts have invited additional countries at their discretion. But the economic might of the G7 is waning - in 1990, the group accounted for just over half of the world's GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund. Now it's just under 30%. It needs influential new friends.
9-14	Moscow and Beijing lashed out against the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Hiroshima, where leaders of major democracies pledged new measures targeting Russia and spoke in one voice on their growing concerns over China. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Saturday slammed the G7 for indulging in their “own greatness” with an agenda that aimed to “deter” Russia and China. Meanwhile China’s Foreign Ministry accused G7 leaders of “hindering international peace” and said the group needed to “reflect on its behavior and change course.” Beijing had made “serious démarches” to host country Japan and “other parties” over their decision to “smear and attack” China, it said. Both Russia’s brutal assault on Ukraine and how to handle an increasingly assertive Beijing have loomed over the three-day gathering of the world’s leading industrialized democracies taking place in Japan – just across regional seas from both countries – where Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky made a surprise, in-person appearance. G7 member countries made the group’s most detailed articulation of a shared position on China to date – stressing the need to cooperate with the world’s second-largest economy, but also to counter its “malign practices” and “coercion” in a landmark joint communique Saturday.
9-15	When Russian troops poured into Ukraine over a year ago, many experts foresaw a strategic windfall for China, with the United States distracted again by a war far from Asia. Now, Beijing is increasingly alarmed that the Western bloc backing Ukraine is entrenching itself in China’s neighborhood. The leaders of the Group of 7 nations last weekend pledged more support for Kyiv and angered Beijing by challenging its claims to the South China Sea, vowing to resist economic coercion, and pressing China on human rights abuses in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. Days after, Moscow and Beijing are reinforcing their relationship by holding security and trade talks, with Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin of Russia leading a delegation of business tycoons on a visit to China.

Albert Muchanga says instead his continent wants a future of ""genuine and mutually beneficial relationships"" with its trade partners. It comes as the AU's chair has been invited to the G7 summit in Japan amid intensifying competition with China for Africa's natural resources. With Western powers seeking greater trade links with the continent, there have been visits to a host of African countries in the run-up to the summit from the leaders of France and Germany, as well as the US vice-president.

9-18	"Volodymyr Zelensky has accused some Arab leaders of ""turning a blind eye"" to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, ahead of his trip to the G7 in Japan. The Ukrainian president made the comments while attending an Arab League summit in Saudi Arabia on Friday. Of the Arab League nations, only Syria has openly supported Russia's invasion. Others have sought to maintain good relations with Moscow. But some states must reflect on their ties with Russia, Mr Zelensky said. ""Unfortunately, there are some in the world and here among you who turn a blind eye to those [prisoner of war] cages and illegal annexations,"" said Mr Zelensky. ""I'm here so that everyone can take an honest look, no matter how hard the Russians try to influence, there must still be independence."" Mr Zelensky also told the assembled leaders in Jeddah that his country was defending itself from colonisers and imperialists, appearing to invoke the Arab world's own history of invasion and occupation. Host nation Saudi Arabia has walked a delicate line on the conflict - on the one hand supporting a UN resolution calling for Russia to withdraw its troops and pledging $400m in humanitarian aid to Ukraine, while on the other hand resisting imposing sanctions on Russia, preferring to see itself as neutral on the conflict."
9-19	"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will join leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies in Hiroshima, Japan, Zelenskyy's farthest trip from his war-torn country, as G-7 members pledge to bring ""comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine."" Zelenskyy had been expected to address the group by videolink Sunday but Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov, speaking on national television, confirmed Zelenskyy would attend the summit. ""Very important matters will be decided there and therefore the physical presence of our president is an absolutely important thing in order to defend our interests,"" he said. Confirmation of Zelenskyy's attendance came as G-7 leaders from the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Japan and the European Union, reaffirmed their ""commitment to stand together against Russia's illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine."""

10-7	Datasets from CVPR 2023 publications are now browsable through FiftyOne Teams at the Voxel51 booth and at cvpr.fiftyone.ai The annual IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) is here! Known for its prestigious nature and exceptional creativity, researchers from all over the world share their published findings while continuing to push the boundaries of computer vision, machine learning and AI. Recently, we published an interesting blog post analyzing the statistics behind this year’s papers. From there, we learned that out of 9,155 submissions, 2,359 papers were accepted to this year’s conference. After some investigating, we found that 59 of the 2,359 accepted papers were associated with a new dataset. That’s 2.5% — impressive, right?! As a team who has built multiple datasets of our own over the last few years, we know full well the labor that goes into making a dataset. Since we are a team that fundamentally believes in the value of visualizing and analyzing during research and development in AI, we decided to make it possible to take a gander at some of these datasets for CVPR 2023 attendees in Vancouver. Over the last couple weeks, our team at Voxel51 added a handful of these datasets to FiftyOne; today, we are publishing it live at cvpr.fiftyone.ai.

What is now becoming somewhat of a signature, the artist lathers the debut in her very own saintly vocals. This is a four-track exposé of emotive dance music. The A1 ‘Arc’ sets the tone. Flexing her muscles in sound design, PG pieces together a shimmering house runner. Featuring laser-like chords and delectable drum patterns, ‘Arc’ sends you skyward. Racking up giant streaming numbers and snaring features on more than 20 Spotify Editorial playlists, this one’s an underground bullseye. 'Empathy’ is the next to arrive. A call and response record that walks a lovely tightrope, perfectly balanced in both vocals and production. As the name suggests, the piece is stacked with deep motif’s that act as a window into Pretty Girl’s day-to-day. Her standout vocal production to date is met with her distinctive driving percussion and melancholic chord progressions.
11-5	Imagine a world where the animal kingdom is not what it seems. In “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” there was high anticipation for a thrilling clash between biomechanical and robotic animals, locked in an epic battle against formidable villains led by the menacing Scourge, a Decepticon in a bid to save the universe as it should be particularly with the title. Let’s face it, we have faced past disappointments with other Transformers series, Transformers: Age of Extinction in 2014 left a bitter taste with its drawn-out storyline. Although, in 2018, the Bumblebee prequel had a glimpse of hope. It was by far the best of the Transformers franchise. Now, with over 4 years of preparation and with a Box office of $171 million, one would have expected the Transformers: Rise of the Beasts to carry on this momentum, to be the crowning achievement of recent Transformers films. However, it fell short due to a lack of clear direction in both plot and character development.

""We wanted to let the lyrics tell the story and message, and allow the visuals to connect to the audience in a very personal and human way,"" Levine, 44, tells PEOPLE exclusively of the video, which was shot in Malibu.

""But with a heartfelt and honest quality to it all."""
11-8	Maroon 5 has shared a new single, “Middle Ground.” The acoustically-driven track tackles frontman Adam Levine’s alleged affair that surfaced late last year. The pop-rock band is taking things in a near-country route with just an acoustic guitar backing up Levine’s vocals. VIDEOS BY AMERICAN SONGWRITER He sings wistfully on the track, Both of our mothers are terrified / And I’m crying out to an empty sky / Tell me if I hit the ground / And I fall down to my knees / Would you hear the sound? The band is slated to perform the track on The Voice season finale on May 23, per People. Check out the track, below.
11-9	Adam Levine made his new music video with Maroon 5 a family affair. The band dropped the music video for their new song, “Middle Ground,” on Tuesday, May 23, and it includes footage of Adam, 44, spending time with his wife, Behati Prinsloo, and their two daughters, Dusty Rose, 6, and Gio Grace, 5. The couple also has a five-month-old child they welcomed in January, but their third bundle of joy was not filmed for the video. The Grammy Award-winning musician‘s wife makes her first appearance during the song’s chorus. As Adam sings, “If I hit the ground / And I fall down to my knees / Would you hear the sound,” Behati, 34, arrives at a lively picnic with him and the band. As the second verse begins, Adam is then pictured in the recording studio with his wife and kids sitting on a nearby couch as spectators. Shortly after, several clips of the family lying on a hammock together play. “I’m not mine, I’m not yours / I’m not sure of anything,” he sings as the beautiful montage plays over the emotional ballad.
11-10	Maroon 5 has released a music video to go along with their new single “Middle Ground.” The band will be performing the song on The Voice finale Tuesday night. Frontman Adam Levine described the music video as “heartfelt and honest.” Maroon 5 Releases ‘Middle Ground’ Music Video The music video cuts between the band performing the song and enjoying an outdoor meal. Levine’s wife, model Behati Prinsloo, appears with him in the video. Levine said they wanted the video to have “a heartfelt and honest quality.” “The creative,” Levine told People, “was to focus on the band — together — through a series of documentary-like images and vignettes: showing the process of creating the track, a ‘making the song’ with the band playing, discussing things and working parts out, including the casual goofing-off moments.” Levine and Prinsloo’s daughters Dusty Rose and Gio Grace also appear in the video. At one point in the clip, the family shares a sweet moment as the couple lies together in a hammock. Earlier this year, the pair welcomed a third child together.
11-11	Adam Levine is ready to take center stage on The Voice one more time. Four years after exiting the singing competition show as a coach, the Maroon 5 frontman will return for the season 23 finale on May 23, where he and the band will perform their new single “Middle Ground.” The new music will release May 19, just days before they play it live for the first time-and release the accompanying music video. And what can fans expect from the group’s new track? “‘Middle Ground’ came together in a flurry of inspiration,” Maroon 5 said in a press release. “It rallies around a message of fragility and humanity on both a personal and universal scale.” The group added that the song may remind listeners of their earlier work, like their beloved debut album Songs About Jane, but “with a whole era of wisdom and experience behind it.” The timing of Adam’s return on The Voice-where he was a coach for 16 seasons-is especially poignant as it comes as his fellow original coach, Blake Shelton, leaves the red rotating chair behind. The famed country singer, who confirmed his departure in April, is the only remaining original coach from the singing show’s 2011 debut, giving him a whopping total of 23 seasons under his belt. However, Blake’s tenure on the show continued longer than even he anticipated. “I think I was close to calling it a day right when COVID hit,” he told Today in February. “And then, because of COVID, I didn’t want to walk away from the show and leave everybody in a bind.” For the 46-year-old, leaving is bittersweet. “I met my wife on this show,” Blake, who wed former coach Gwen Stefani in 2021, continued. “It’s changed my life in every way it possibly can.” And in addition to bringing Blake and Gwen together, it also formed a sweet friendship between him and Adam-who constantly traded playful barbs. While they played up their frenemies dynamic on the show together, when Adam’s departure was announced, Blake admitted he would miss his rival. “Having a hard time wrapping my head around @adamlevine not being at @NBCTheVoice anymore,” Blake tweeted at the time. “After 16 seasons that changed both of ours lives.”
11-12	Maroon 5 have dropped a new single, Middle Ground. The poignant pop ballad marks the American band's first release since 2021, when they put out their most recent album, 'Jordi', in the summer of that year. The Grammy winners will perform Middle Ground on the season finale of The Voice US on May 23, the same day its accompanying David Dobkin-directed video premieres. Maroon 5 began a Las Vegas residency at Dolby Live at Park MGM in March, with more dates scheduled at the venue in July and August. They'll also take over The O2, London and Birmingham's Resorts World Arena in July, following a run of European shows and festival appearances.
11-13	While most corporate bond funds specialise in either investment grade or high yield securities, we believe some of the most interesting opportunities sit on the borderline between these two categories: the so-called crossover names. Crossover credit mainly covers those bonds rated “BB” by the principal rating agencies. These companies will usually have more debt or greater cyclicality than investment grade issuers. The leverage ratio, which compares debt to earnings before interest, tax and depreciation, is typically between three and four times for BB-rated companies. This segment of the market is around half of the global high yield bond opportunity set by value and covers a range of economic sectors, including telecoms, autos, energy, healthcare, consumer products and financial services. In general, we believe that these issuers offer reasonable risk-adjusted returns. The average US dollar yield on global BB companies at the end of February was roughly 7%. While the BB segment is classified as “non-investment grade”, we believe many of these companies are quite capable of servicing their liabilities over the medium term. Moody’s data since 1983 suggests that the average loss rate for BB issuers is small: normally less than 1% per annum. Averages can be misleading, because there’s variation within the group, but we consider this level of delinquency quite manageable, especially with the help of active security selection. Defaults are not the only consideration: clearly there are other factors to consider, such as liquidity risk and downgrade risk, but generally we think BBs offer a compelling trade off of risk against reward. In summary, we think the BB market offers a sweet spot for corporate bond fund managers where they can capture some of the yield from non-investment grade debt, without taking exposure to as many ‘blow-ups’.

However, there is a compromise approach which would avoid expropriation while achieving most of Labour’s goals. Legislation could be amended to allow local authorities to compulsorily buy land that it has zoned as social housing at the lower land value commensurate with that use. The landowners who would be required to sell at this price would retain the right to further payments if the land was subsequently used to develop higher value properties such as housing for sale. They could even be granted the right to repurchase the land at the original sale price if not developed within, say, 20 years.
11-16	By Leon Stafford, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution June 20, 2023 Clayton County Schools will break ground today on a new $92 million middle school for Forest Park. The event will take place at 5 p.m. at the site of the new building, which is at 930 Finley Drive in Forest Park. The Clayton County Board of Education in April hired Peachtree City’s Meja Construction to build the $92.2 Forest Park Million School, which will replace the current Forest Park middle with a new three-floor building. The project is expected to accommodate 1,200 students over more than 228,000 square feet. It will be funded with $86.6 million in SPLOST revenue and $5.5 million from the Georgia Department of Education.
11-17	We have before our Town Council and School Committee a resolution to support an extension of the obscenity laws to include graphic representations. We have seen examples presented to us of such representations being present in our communities’ schools and libraries. To some members of our community these works, verbal or graphic, are vile and obscene. To others of our community, the same works are regarded as helpful, even necessary, representations to aid children attempting to understand their feelings and their bodies. Clearly we do not, and perhaps cannot, agree on a definition of obscenity. Nevertheless, we can agree that at both extremes of our community people are clearly offended and threatened both for themselves and on behalf of their children.
11-18	For Sen. Joe Manchin, America’s path forward seems simple: create a middle and everything else will fall into place. The West Virginia Democrat, who is being discussed by some Washington insiders as a potential candidate on a No Labels Party “Unity” ticket, where a Democrat and Republican share the national ticket for president and vice president, sees an America that is being forced apart. His goal, both now and moving forward, is to work to bring the nation back together. “I want to make people understand that the middle is still where the elections are going to be won or lost. But no one’s putting any credence in that because they think well, we’ll go this way. This is where the winner is going to be,” Manchin said. “My whole movement is basically how do you save the nation? We’ve got to save this nation. And it can’t be about one party doing it by themselves. We all have to make this work.” When it comes to a possible third-party run, whether Manchin’s involved or not (he continues to only say, when asked, that he will announce his intentions at the end of this year), he said such a unity ticket would face an uphill battle.

12-0	The 2023 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2022–23 season and conclusion to the season's playoffs. The best-of-seven playoffs was played between the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat and the Western Conference champion Denver Nuggets. The series started on June 1, and concluded in a Denver victory on June 12.[1] The Nuggets defeated the Heat in four of five games, winning their first championship in franchise history after 47 seasons in the NBA. Denver's Nikola Jokić was unanimously voted the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP),[2][3] after averaging 30.2 points, 14.0 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 1.4 blocks while shooting 58.3% from the field and 42.1% from the 3-point line.[4] Jokić is the lowest-selected player to ever win Finals MVP, being the 41st pick of the 2014 NBA draft.[5] This marked the first NBA Finals appearance for Denver. This was also the second Finals to feature a No. 8 seed, along with the 1999 NBA Finals.[6]
12-1	"The Denver Nuggets beat the Miami Heat 94-89 in Game 5 of the NBA Finals to win their first-ever championship on Monday (13 June). Ending a 47-year wait for Denver, Nikola Jokic was named Finals MVP. He led the way again on this night with 28 points, 16 rebounds and four assists. Jokic averaged 30.2 points, 14.0 rebounds and 7.2 assists for the series with a pair of triple-doubles. He is the first player in NBA history to lead the play-offs in total points, rebounds and assists. “It’s good, it’s good,” said Jokic, who is the lowest drafted player ever to win the Finals MVP award. “The job is done. We can go home now. ""We are not rooting for ourselves. We're rooting for the guy next to us. This is a great group of people, a great group of team-mates. “This group is amazing.”"
12-2	For the first time ever, the Denver Nuggets are NBA champions. The Nuggets won 94 to 89 against the Miami Heat Monday night — making history for the team. This is not only the Nuggets’ first time winning the Championship, but it is also their first time making it to the NBA Finals. It wasn’t until this year that the Nuggets won the Western Conference — they lost in their four previous trips to the Western Conference Finals in 1978, 1985, 2009, and 2020. Two-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic led the team to the Larry O’Brien Trophy. Stephen Curry and Golden State Warriors Defeat Boston Celtics to Win 2022 NBA Finals The Nuggets finished the 2022-23 regular season with a record of 53-29 — the best record in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, the Nuggets defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves in five games before beating the Phoenix Suns in six games.
12-3	Kristaps Porzingis is going from maybe the worst team in the NBA to the Eastern Conference favorite. The Boston Celtics have the best 2024 NBA Finals odds amid the news that the team is on the verge of completing a trade for Kristaps Porzingis. The Los Angeles Clippers and Washington Wizards are also involved in the blockbuster trade. The Celtics are expected to trade Malcolm Brogdon and Danilo Gallinari in the trade, which has yet to be officially completed. With Porzingis likely headed to Boston, the Celtics have +470 odds to win the 2024 NBA Finals at FanDuel Sportsbook. Only the Denver Nuggets have better 2024 NBA Finals odds than Boston. The Nuggets are slight favorites to repeat at +460. There is now a clear separation between the Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks. The Bucks' +500 NBA Finals odds rank third in the league. Just one week ago, Milwaukee was tied with Denver at +460 to win next year's title. Boston is a +210 favorite to win the East. The Bucks have +230 odds, making them the Celtics' biggest threat. The Philadelphia 76ers are a distant third with +650 odds to reach the NBA Finals. The addition of Porzingis might not swing the title, though he could play a key role in helping Boston get over the hump. The Celtics needed a roster shakeup after making three conference finals appearances in four years with no rings to show for it.

12-5	The Boston Celtics, who reached five of the last seven Eastern Conference Finals and made the 2022 NBA Finals, appear primed for another deep playoff run in 2023-24. On Wednesday, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported the Celtics were working toward a three-team trade with the Los Angeles Clippers and Washington Wizards that would send Kristaps Porziņģis to Boston. Marcus Morris, Amir Coffey, Danilo Gallinari and the 30th pick of Thursday's NBA draft would go to Washington, while Malcolm Brogdon would land with the Clippers. The idea of Porziņģis teaming up with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown drew rave reviews on social media:

With free agency right around the corner, it's time for Los Angeles Lakers fans to ask themselves an age-old question: which players from the NBA Finals can our team poach for themselves this summer?"
12-7	The Boston Celtics didn’t wait long to shake up their roster after falling short in the NBA playoffs in the 2022-23 season. Boston reportedly is trading reigning Sixth Man of the Year Award winner Malcolm Brogdon to the Los Angeles Clippers in a three-team deal that involves the Washington Wizards. In return, Boston will receive Wizards big man Kristaps Porzingis, according to The Athletic’s Shams Charania.

With Robert Williams III dealing with injuries in recent seasons and Al Horford aging, Boston receives a big man that can score the ball at a high level. Porzingis is opting into his player option for the 2023-24 season to facilitate the deal.

Relaxing on the beach, he begins the video by saying “Hella proud of our guys this year. As we always try to achieve our goals, I think it’s very important not to lose sight of the journey and all of the great times together as a unit this year.” This refers to the journey for the Heat to make the Finals. From starting the regular season with a 2-5 record to being one loss away from elimination in the play-in tournament, the Heat overcame every obstacle. They are just the second No. 8 seed to make the Finals. Butler wraps up the video by saying “Love my guys and I wouldn’t want to be in that position with anybody else. I appreciate y’all and here’s to a couple more”

Porzingis is coming off a season in which he averaged a career-best 23.2 points per game and made 65 starts, which tied a career-high, after being limited to less than 60 games during each of the past four seasons following his ACL surgery in 2018. The Wizards had previously agreed to a trade sending All-Star guard Bradley Beal to the Phoenix Suns on Sunday (June 18). The former Florida standout is a three-time All-Star and has averaged 22.1 points, 4.3 assists and 4.1 rebounds, but the Wizards have only made the playoffs during five of his 11 NBA seasons, which includes missing the postseason during each of the past two seasons, as well as four of the last five seasons."

12-12	The Detroit Pistons need look no further than this year’s NBA Finals for a blueprint for small market teams. The Denver Nuggets defeated the Miami Heat in five games to win their first NBA championship. Of the best players on the court in any of those games, only Jamal Murray, 7th overall, was drafted in the top ten. Nikola Jokic, the best player in the series and perhaps the world (at the moment), was drafted 41st during a Taco Bell commercial. The Heat fielded a team of overlooked talent including Jimmy Butler (30th), Bam Adebayo (14th), and undrafted players Caleb Martin, Max Strus, Gabe Vincent, Duncan Robinson, and Udonis Haslem’s 29.8 seconds. RELATED STORY: Pistons could work a 3-team trade with Mavericks and Warriors These Finals showed that teams that maintain their culture and develop their players can find the sustained success that has eluded Detroit recently.

Butler led the Heat to the Finals — their second appearance in the four years he’s been in Miami — where they lost to the Denver Nuggets 4-1. He averaged 26.9 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists throughout the playoff run, a personal performance that was punctuated by an unreal 56-point onslaught against the Milwaukee Bucks in Game 4 of the first round.

12-15	After the most-watched NBA Playoffs in five years, but one of the least-watched NBA Finals on record, where does the league’s postseason stand in the ratings? The 2023 NBA Playoffs averaged a 2.7 rating and 5.12 million viewers across ABC, ESPN, TNT and NBA TV, marking the highest average in five years (2018: 5.21M) and third-highest in a decade. After bottoming out at a 1.8 and 3.08 million in the fanless summer and fall “bubble” of 2020, playoff viewership has increased in three-straight years. Despite the five-year high, the postseason ended on a quiet note as the five-game Nuggets-Heat NBA Finals topped only the COVID-delayed series of 2020 and 2021 as the least-watched since 2007. The NBA’s overall health as a television product is often judged on the basis of the Finals, as those are the highest rated and most-watched games of a given season. With the past four Finals ranking among the six least-watched on record, some of the league’s critics have argued that the numbers show a sharp and lasting reduction in popularity that is unique to the post-2020 NBA. This argument suggests that the greater-than-usual activism exhibited by NBA players during the 2020 “bubble” turned off fans, perhaps permanently. These claims are usually supported by citing viewership for the Finals in isolation. By contrast, the following analysis is supported by three decades of postseason data, comparisons with other leagues, and at least some mention of the overall trends facing television.
12-16	The Denver Nuggets won their first NBA championship Monday night, downing the Miami Heat 94-89 at Ball Arena in Denver to take Game 5 of the NBA Finals. Two-time MVP Nikola Jokić led the way for the Nuggets with a game-high 28 points and 16 rebounds. “It was an amazing effort by the team,” he told ABC after the game. “It was an ugly game. We couldn’t make shots but at the end, we figured out how to defend.” The Serbian big man was voted Most Valuable Player of the NBA Finals, and is the first center to win the award named after the late Bill Russell since Shaquille O’Neal of the Lakers in 2002. Hours after the game, at least nine people were injured in a mass shooting in downtown Denver, where crowds had gathered to celebrate the city’s first NBA championship.
12-17	The Denver Nuggets won their first NBA championship in the most psychical game of this year's five-game series. In winning their first title, Denver ends years of recent frustration in not being able to reach the mountain top. The Nuggets' 94-89 win was the first NBA title in 47 years of existence. The Miami Heat were seeking to become the first No. 8 seed to win a title. The game was marred by, uh, defense. The teams looked tight early, and Denver opened 1 of 17 from deep. It was the first time this series that the winning team failed to score 100. In fact, it was the first time the winning team did not score at least 100 since the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Golden State Warriors in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals by the near-identical count of 93-89. Two-time MVP (2020-21 and 2021-22) Nikola Jokic won the NBA Finals Bill Russell MVP Award. He scored 28 points on 12-of-16 shooting to go along with 16 rebounds and four assists.

Those questions will be answered before the midnight hour Monday when Game 5 (8:30 ET, ABC) comes to a conclusion. The Denver Nuggets are in perfect position to win their first championship: they’re at home, Nikola Jokic still hasn’t been contained and the confidence of the Nuggets is mile high. The city is bracing for a special moment, a reason to celebrate, a time to unify. That’s how much these Nuggets mean to Denver — long considered a football town — as they try to cash in for the first time, up 3-1 in the series.
13-0	Next to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Fast Saga is the biggest collection of macho movie stars in the business. They've got Diesel, Statham, The Rock, Gibson, Russell, and Cena, and now, they're adding Momoa to the mix. Fast X is putting its new star front and center in the marketing, so it's important to know just who Jason Momoa will be portraying in the upcoming film. Every new entry in the Fast Saga has added a big star or two to the roster. Some are totally new figures, others are deeply tied to the family. Momoa is sort of neither. He's connected to the franchise, but only true fans will have any investment in his character.
13-1	When The Fast and the Furious premiered in theaters in 2001, it seems almost impossible to imagine that anyone could have predicted how massive of a franchise it has become. What started as a fairly straightforward racing action movie has blossomed into a massive multi-billion dollar franchise with an ever-evolving universe. To this day, there have been nine films in the Fast and Furious series, ten if you include the Hobbs and Shaw spin-off film, and the franchise, isn't going anywhere quite yet. The tenth, and supposedly penultimate, official Fast film is officially here with Fast X (or Fast & Furious 10, however, you want to call it), as the Fast Family looks to face their toughest adversary yet, Dante, the psychopathic son of an old foe. If you didn't have time to catch up with Fast and Furious films before this entry, and you'd rather have a brief rundown of where we left off with these characters in F9, we got you covered. To get a full rundown of the cast and characters of Fast X, including both familiar favorites and exciting newcomers, all you have to do is check the guide below.
13-2	"Jason Momoa plays the superhero Aquaman in the DCEU, but he's taking on a more villainous role in the upcoming film ""Fast X."" Momoa, 43, opened up to Men's Health for the magazine's May/June 2023 cover story about him joining the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise, revealing he approached star Vin Diesel and came in with some ideas of his own. MORE: Jason Momoa's Dante tries to break up Dom's 'family' in new 'Fast X' trailer ""I saw the first 'Fast' and the one that was in Brazil ['Fast Five'], and they're amazing -- they always are,"" he told the publication. ""I talked to Vin and said, 'Yo, Daddy-o, I'm here to support you, but I'm going to do it my way. I'm going to be a bad man, and you're going to want to take me out!'"" In the film, the 10th in the mainline ""Fast & Furious"" series, Momoa plays Dante, a man seeking revenge following the death of his father at the hands of Diesel's character Dom and the rest of his crew in 2011's ""Fast Five."""
13-3	"Fast X (also known as Fast & Furious 10) is a 2023 American action film directed by Louis Leterrier from a screenplay written by Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin, who also co-wrote the story with Zach Dean. It is the sequel to F9 (2021), the tenth main installment, and the eleventh installment overall in the Fast & Furious franchise. It stars Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto alongside an ensemble cast including Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, John Cena, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Scott Eastwood, Daniela Melchior, Alan Ritchson, Helen Mirren, Brie Larson, Rita Moreno, Jason Statham, Jason Momoa, and Charlize Theron. In the film, Dom must protect his family from Dante Reyes, who seeks revenge for his father's death and the loss of his family's fortune."
13-4	With a tenth film planned since 2014, and a two-part finale planned since October 2020, Lin was confirmed to return to direct with the main cast attached. The film's official title was revealed when principal photography began in April 2022. Lin left as director later that month, citing creative differences, though he retained writing and producing credits. Leterrier was then hired as his replacement a week later and performed several uncredited rewrites to the screenplay. Longtime franchise composer Brian Tyler returned to score the film. With an estimated production budget of $340 million, it is the eighth-most expensive film ever made. Filming lasted until that August, taking place in London, Rome, Turin, other Italian cities, Lisbon, and Los Angeles.
13-5	"Dominic Toretto and his team are requested by the Agency to steal a computer chip during its transit in Rome, Italy. Dom and his wife Letty Ortiz stay behind with his son Brian ""Little B"" Marcos, while the rest of the team travels to Rome. However, a wounded Cipher arrives at Dom's home and informs him that Dante Reyes, the son of drug lord Hernan Reyes, has turned her crew against her by threatening their families and is using them to target Dom in revenge for his father's death and the loss of his family's fortune ten years prior.[b] Little Nobody takes Cipher into custody but reveals to Dom and Letty that there is no Agency mission in Rome. Realizing that Dante set them up, Dom and Letty go to rescue the team."
13-6	In Fast X, Jason Momoa plays Dante Reyes. And he might be the deadliest, most conniving villain the Fast & Furious crew has ever faced. Dominic Torreto and his family of street racers turned super spies have gone up against a long line of dangerous international criminals. But for the first time, they seem to have met their match in Dante Reyes. Jason Momoa’s character in Fast X might literally be insane. The Fast & Furious crew killed his father in Fast Five, and now he’s back for revenge. But he’s constantly laughing, cracking jokes, and having drinks with a couple of dead guys. Jason Momoa might be the Joker of the Fast & Furious franchise. His character spent time in a mental institution. He confronts Dom with serious moral quandaries. And he wears a lot of purple. Dante Reyes even drives a purple Chevy when he races Dom.
13-7	Fast X has been out in cinemas for a month, but it is already available to rent or buy digitally in the UK. The latest instalment in Vin Diesel's long-running series can be rented or bought via Amazon/Prime Video, Apple TV/iTunes, and the Microsoft Store. Considering the film premiered in cinemas on May 19, that's only a month between its big screen debut and UK digital release. In the US, there was even less of a wait, with just three weeks separating the releases.
13-8	What happens in the Fast X ending? It should be remembered that Fast X was never intended to be a stand-alone chapter of the Fast & Furious series; from the very start, it was intended as the first of a two-part story and now even that might be extended — all of which is to say,Fast X ends on what isn’t literally a cliffhanger, but comes pretty close. Fast X Marvel Studios to skip Hall H at San Diego Comic-Con 2023 image Marvel Studios to skip Hall H at San Diego Comic-Con 2023 Read more on Popverse Throughout the entire movie, new villain Dante (Jason Momoa) has revealed himself to be the man with a plan, as ridiculous as it may seem — which makes it entirely reasonable under the explosive logic of the movie that he manages to seize seeming victory from the jaws of defeat by revealing that it has always been his plan to let Dom (Vin Diesel) rescue his son Brian from Dante, so that they could end up in the same car, on top of a dam, just in time for the first of two shocking climactic moments: Aimes, the head of The Agency in the wake of Mr. Nobody’s disappearance in F9, is actually working for Dante, allowing him to apparently shoot down a plane containing Han, Tej, Roman, and Ramsay, with all four apparently dying in an explosion as their plane crashes. But wait, that’s not dramatic enough, leading to a second shock moment… albeit one that’s been glimpsed in trailers for the movie. After watching his friends die, Dom then has to race into action as two gas tankers surrounding him explode on the top of the dam, leaving Dom and Brian to speed down the front of the dam to escape the explosion as it reaches for them… but even when they get to the bottom in one piece, they’re still in danger, because as the movie ends, Dante blows up the entire dam with Dom and Brian right there in the face of both the explosion and all of the water that looks as if it’s about to drown them both. Things aren’t looking good for the extended Toretto family, safe to say. (And that’s ignoring Jakob’s death earlier in the movie; sorry, John Cena fans.)
13-9	"The Fast & Furious family is for life — even if your character dies. Fast X ended with a surprise cameo by Gal Gadot, whose Gisele seemingly died during the lengthy runway chase that ended 2013's Fast & Furious 6. After resurrecting Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Han (Sung Kang), the Fast and the Furious franchise brought back Gisele in the unlikeliest of places: aboard a submarine in Antarctica. Fast X left off with Letty and Cipher (Charlize Theron) escaping an Agency black site prison as part of a plan that will continue into Fast & Furious 11. ""Wow. I wish I could say something. If I'm going to say something to you, somebody is going to jump into my room and tie my mouth,"" Gadot told Total Film magazine about her Fast future. Gadot added that 2009's Fast & Furious was ""the first feature I'd ever done as an actress,"" introducing the future Wonder Woman star to global audiences — and the Fast family."
13-10	There’s a scene in the latest Fast & Furious film, Fast X, where Aimes (Alan Ritchson) – the government agent tasked with apprehending Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew – gives a rundown of the heroes’ backstory: Let’s start back at the beginning … Los Angeles, 2001 … Humble roots, local kids … Street racers who became hijackers … Graduated to high-speed smuggling, mobile jailbreaks, train robberies … If it could be done in a car, they did it … If it violates the laws of God and gravity, they did it twice. On one level, the scene is a recap reel. Monitors inside Aimes’ hi-tech HQ play clips from the Fast family’s biggest stunts. These clips are designed to initiate casual viewers into the Furious-verse, helping them to make sense of what’s to come.
13-11	Roman Pearce has been through a lot during his time in the Fast and Furious franchise, but Fast X suggests his theory about being invincible might actually be true. It’s no secret that the Fast and Furious franchise has had its fair share of wild action, often leaving its characters in precarious positions, and, in some instances, even leading to certain deaths — and resurrections.

From street racing to high-tech heists and beyond, the series has kept its audience hooked with its adrenaline-pumping action and dynamic characters. Fast and Furious fans are eagerly anticipating the release of the franchise's tenth installment, set to hit theaters on April 7th, 2023. However, many are wondering when they'll be able to watch ""Fast X"" from the comfort of their homes. While streaming services like Peacock, Prime Video, and Netflix have yet to announce the official release date for the film, there are still ways to catch it online for free. Fans can use online platforms like Putlocker or 123movies to stream the movie illegally, but it's important to note that these sites are not only unethical but also pose a risk to personal privacy and security.

13-13	"Fast & Furious (also known as The Fast and the Furious) is a media franchise centered on a series of action films that are largely concerned with street racing, heists, spies, and family. The franchise also includes short films, a television series, toys, video games, live shows, and theme park attractions. The films are distributed by Universal Pictures. The first film, based on the 1998 Vibe magazine article ""Racer X"" by Ken Li[2] and written by Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist, and David Ayer, was released in 2001. It began the original tetralogy of films focused on illegal street racing, which culminated in the film Fast & Furious (2009). The series transitioned towards heists and spying with Fast Five (2011), which was followed by five sequels in that genre, the most recent of which, Fast X, was released on May 19, 2023."
13-14	Joseph Jason Namakaeha Momoa (/mɒˈmɒə/; born August 1, 1979[1]) is an American actor. He made his acting debut as Jason Ioane on the syndicated action drama series Baywatch: Hawaii (1999–2001), which was followed by portrayals of Ronon Dex on the Syfy science fiction series Stargate Atlantis (2005–2009), and Khal Drogo in the first two seasons of the HBO fantasy drama series Game of Thrones (2011–2012). He went on to play the lead roles in the Discovery Channel historical drama series Frontier (2016–2018) and the Apple TV+ science fiction series See (2019–2022). Since 2016, Momoa has portrayed Aquaman in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), including in the solo feature Aquaman (2018). Momoa has also played Duncan Idaho in the science fiction film Dune (2021), and has starred in the action film Fast X (2023).
13-15	"Joseph Jason Namakaeha Momoa was born on August 1, 1979, in Honolulu, Hawaii. He is the son of Coni (Lemke), a photographer, and Joseph Momoa, a painter. His father is of Native Hawaiian and Samoan descent; and his mother, who is from Iowa, is of German, Irish, and Native American ancestry. Jason was raised in Norwalk, Iowa, by his mother. After high school, he moved to Hawaii, where he landed a lead role, beating out of thousands of hopefuls in the TV series Baywatch (1989) (known as ""Baywatch Hawaii"" in its 10th season). When the show ended, he spent the next couple of years traveling around the world. In 2001, he moved to Los Angeles, where he continued to pursue an acting career. In 2004, after the short-lived TV series North Shore (2004), he was cast as the popular character ""Ronon Dex"" in the TV series Stargate: Atlantis (2004), which achieved a cult-like following. In 2010, he appeared in the Emmy-nominated HBO series Game of Thrones (2011), playing the Dothraki king, Khal Drogo. To illustrate to the producers that he was Khal Drogo, he performed the Haka, a traditional war dance of the Maori of New Zealand. The audition was with the same casting director who was casting the titular role in the reboot of Conan the Barbarian (2011). Four weeks after being cast as the popular Robert E. Howard character, Momoa began shooting in Bulgaria. His approach, like that of the filmmakers, was to pull from the eight decades of comics and stories as well as the Frank Frazetta images rather than the hugely popular 1982 movie. Jason has a production company, Pride of Gypsies, in which he is expanding his career from actor to filmmaker. He has directed a couple of short films and is working on his feature film debut Road to Paloma (2014), which is pulled from a series of stories that he's been developing over the years, which he calls the Brown Bag Diaries: Ridin' the Blinds in B Minor (2010). Jason lives with his wife, actress Lisa Bonet, with whom he has two children, Lola and Nakoa-Wolf."
13-16	"Warner Bros.' highly anticipated live-action Minecraft film, based on the popular video game series of the same name, is slated to begin filming on Aug. 7, 2023, according to a report from Production List. This gives the film plenty of wiggle room prior to its scheduled release date of April 4, 2025. While details remain slim, Production List reports that Minecraft will begin filming in New Zealand, though the length of the shoot remains unclear. Also unclear are any of the major plot points of the film, though a logline from Warner Bros. states, ""The malevolent Ender Dragon sets out on a path of destruction, prompting a young girl and her group of unlikely adventurers to set out to save the Overworld."" The film will star Jason Momoa in the lead role. The actor is no stranger to Warner Bros., having collaborated with the studio for his role as Aquaman in the DC Extended Universe, and he also had a part in Warner Bros.' sci-fi epic Dune in 2021. Momoa will be joined in Minecraft by Matt Berry, known for his work on What We Do in the Shadows. Neither of the roles for Momoa or Berry have been revealed yet."
13-17	With one recent conflict finally being settled, Jason Momoa and Vin Diesel are addressing the rumors of their feuding on Fast X. Momoa starred in the latest installment of the long-running action franchise as Dante Reyes, the son of Fast Five villain Hernan, who enacts a plan of revenge against Diesel's Dominic Toretto and his family for taking his family's money. Fast X is expected to be the first of the final mainline Fast and Furious movies, with Diesel teasing a potential trilogy ahead of its release after an initial two-part plan.

14-0	Lionel Messi’s contract with MLS club Inter Miami is getting closer to being finalized, according to someone familiar with the process. The two-and-a-half-year deal includes an option for 2026. The agreement is worth up to $150 million total from his salary, signing bonus and equity in the team. Messi is expected to exercise his ownership stake in the franchise after he is done playing with Inter Miami. Revenue-sharing agreements with league partners Apple, Adidas and Fanatics are still being negotiated and would be in addition to this total.
14-1	Lionel Messi will make his Inter Miami debut on 21 July, according to the club’s managing owner, Jorge Mas. In an interview with the Miami Herald, Mas said the Argentinian will play in his new club’s Leagues Cup meeting with Liga MX’s Cruz Azul. The match is set for DRV PNK Stadium, the team’s temporary home in Fort Lauderdale while it searches for a permanent stadium in Miami.
14-2	The Herald reported that Messi’s contract is worth between $50m and $60m a year and will include salary, bonuses and equity in the club once he retires. Messi turned down offers from Barcelona and Saudi Arabia’s Al-Hilal to join Inter Miami. According to some reports, the Saudi Arabian deal was worth $400m a year.
14-3	Perhaps Inter Miami and MLS weren’t Messi’s first-choice option this summer, as his father previously stated his son’s desire to return to Barcelona, where he famously won 21 major trophies before an unceremonious exit amid financial troubles in the summer of 2021, but those issues still linger two years later. The offer from Saudi Arabia would have reportedly paid Messi, 35, $1.6 billion over three years.
14-4	Inter Miami managing owner Jorge Mas has said in an interview with The Miami Herald that Lionel Messi will make his Inter Miami debut on July 21, 2023 against Cruz Azul in a Leagues Cup match. It will be played at Inter Miami’s DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, which Mas said they are planning to expand to up to 22,200 from its current capacity of 19,000.
14-5	Inter Miami CF are planning for Lionel Messi to make his debut on July 21 in a Leagues Cup match against Liga MX's Cruz Azul, owner Jorge Mas told reporters Monday. Messi, 35, said earlier this month he intends to sign for Miami after leaving Paris Saint-Germain, although a deal remains to be finalised.
14-6	While Lionel Messi was busy completing his career odyssey in the most dramatic fashion, David Beckham watched from the stands, hopeful his Inter Miami team could land its very own unicorn. The Major League Soccer franchise is reportedly “confident” of signing Messi following the 2022-23 European season, and “close” to a deal making him the highest-paid player in MLS history.
14-7	Messi turns 36 next summer and would join MLS mid-season, after playing every minute of Argentina’s grueling World Cup triumph and a full campaign with Qatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain, who may now make a renewed effort to retain the player and further bask in that World Cup glory. Much like the US men’s national team, MLS has transitioned to an athletic, youth-focused league, shedding the “retirement home” sneers. Older big-name imports have mixed records – for every Beckham and Zlatan, there’s been a flop like Steven Gerrard or Frank Lampard – and Inter itself risks becoming a mere sideshow.
14-8	Various landing spots have been mooted for the all-time great – from Barcelona to the Middle East – but interest from the United States remains. David Beckham co-owned Inter Miami have made no secret of the fact that they would like to welcome Messi to Florida, with coach Phil Neville saying: “I’m not going to deny [it and say] there isn’t truth in the speculation that we’re interested in Lionel Messi. We want to bring the best players in the world to this football club. Messi and [Sergio] Busquets are the two that stand out more in recent years. They're great players who would still be a massive benefit to this organisation. For MLS, it would be a game-changer.”
14-9	Lionel Messi is out of contract at Paris Saint-Germain this summer and his future now at a crossroads, with an offer from Saudi Arabia and a return to Barcelona both options on the table. Messi joined PSG on a two-year contract in the summer of 2021 – with his deal up for renewal in June and talks currently stalled. After a difficult debut campaign in Paris, he has netted 18 goals and provided 19 assists this season and has spoken of his happiness at adapting to life in France this term.
14-10	"Lionel Messi says he's coming to the United States to join the Major League Soccer club Inter Miami. ""I made the decision that I am going to Miami,"" the Argentine superstar said in an interview posted by Spanish outlets SPORT and Mundo Deportivo. ""I still haven't closed it 100%. I'm missing some things but we decided to continue my journey there."" Messi is widely considered to be one of the sport's all-time greatest players, and for many he is at the top of the list. He is Argentina's all-time leading goalscorer, and he led his country to a World Cup victory in December. At club level, he is the all-time leading scorer for FC Barcelona and the Spanish soccer league La Liga. He played the last two seasons with French club Paris Saint-Germain."
14-11	Saudi Arabia scored one of the biggest World Cup upsets ever by beating Lionel Messi's Argentina 2-1 on Tuesday. Messi's quest to win the one major title to elude him got off to a shocking start and brought back memories of Cameroon's 1-0 win over an Argentina team led by Diego Maradona in the opening game of the 1990 World Cup. Goals by Saleh Alshehri and Salem Aldawsari in a five-minute span in the second half gave the Saudis the win. Argentina took an early lead with a 10th-minute penalty by Messi.
14-12	The Paris Saint-Germain star shook hands with a Saudi coaching staff member after the final whistle and stood with his hands on his hips near the center circle, an all-too familiar scene for one of the best players ever who is yet to win the biggest prize in soccer. The unlikely victory was sealed by a somersault by Aldawsari, who brought down a high ball just inside the penalty area, turned one defender, jinked past another and drove a powerful shot past goalkeeper Emi Martinez, who got a hand on the ball but couldn't keep out of the net in the 53rd.
14-13	Lionel Messi's decision to complete a free transfer to join Inter Miami will extend his career until at least 2025. The Argentina international will formally complete his departure from Paris Saint-Germain on June 30 with his contract in Florida set to immediately kick in. Messi is rumoured to have rejected a lucrative offer to join Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal, with Barcelona failing to produce a formal bid, and MLS will be his next stage. The 35-year-old continues to be one of the highest-earning players in world football, despite his advancing years, as he prepares to play on for club and country.
14-14	Due to the structure of the MLS season, running through the summer months in contrast to the majority of European campaigns, Messi has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract in Miami.
14-15	That will bring him up to the end of 2025, as opposed to July 2025, with an option to extend for another 12 months if he wants to play in the 2026 World Cup, hosted across the USA, Canada and Mexico. Details over Messi's prospective contract in Miami have been reported with differing final figures due to MLS rules on salary caps and player rosters. As per reports from the Miami Herald, Messi's deal will be worth $125m-150m/£100m-£120m in total, which breaks down at around $4.1m$5m/£3.3m/£4m per month.
14-16	If the numbers surrounding Messi's contract are accurate, even at the higher end of the scale, he will see a reduction from his PSG wages. He will stay inside the top five on the highest earners list, but his new deal is dwarfed by the sums being raked in by Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema in Saudi Arabia.
14-17	"Top earning footballers June/July 2023 Player	Club	Estimated Annual Salary	Estimated Monthly Salary 1.	Cristiano Ronaldo	Al Nassr	£173m / $213m	£14.4m/$18m 2.	Karim Benzema	Al Ittihad	£169m/$211m	£14m/$17.5m 3.	Kylian Mbappe	PSG	£96m/$110m	£8m/$10m 4.	Neymar	PSG	£48m/$55m	£$4.5m/$4m 5.	Lionel Messi	Inter Miami	£40m-£48m/$50m-$60m	$4.1m$5m/£3.3m/£4m"
14-18	Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappe has hit out at France for its treatment of Lionel Messi during his two seasons in Ligue 1. Messi joined the French champions in 2021 on a free transfer from Barcelona and despite winning the league on two occasions, the forward struggled to adapt to life at PSG.
14-19	Lionel Messi orchestrated another victory for world champions Argentina, as he scored the opening goal of a 2-0 win over a resilient Australia in Beijing. It took him only two minutes to score the opening goal of the friendly match — the fastest goal of his career — with a wonderful curling effort past Maty Ryan. Argentina had more chances in an opening 15 minutes where they ran riot, but Australia soon settled and began to hit Argentina on the break. Striker Mitch Duke had their best chance of the game midway through the first period when his header from a Riley McGree cross forced a great reaction stop from Emiliano Martinez.
15-0	Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a 2023 American science fiction action film based on Hasbro's Transformers toy line, and primarily influenced by the Beast Wars storyline. It is the seventh installment in the Transformers live-action film series. Serving as a standalone sequel to Bumblebee (2018) and prequel to Transformers (2007),[6] the film was directed by Steven Caple Jr. from a screenplay by Joby Harold, Darnell Metayer, Josh Peters, Erich Hoeber, and Jon Hoeber. It stars Anthony Ramos and Dominique Fishback as well as the voice talents of Ron Perlman, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Yeoh, Liza Koshy, Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, Pete Davidson, Colman Domingo, Cristo Fernández, Tongayi Chirisa, and returning franchise regulars Peter Cullen, John DiMaggio, and David Sobolov.
15-1	Following the critical and commercial success of Bumblebee, Paramount Pictures and Hasbro announced a sequel in early 2019. In November 2020, Caple was hired as director for the film. By 2021, Ramos and Fishback were cast in the lead human roles, and details for the film were revealed that summer in a virtual event held by Paramount. Michael Bay, who directed the first five live-action Transformers films and produced Bumblebee, once again serves as producer. Principal photography took place from June to October 2021, with filming locations including Los Angeles, Peru, Montreal, and New York City.
15-2	Transformers: Rise of the Beasts had its premiere at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore on May 27, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 9, 2023, by Paramount Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its action sequences, chemistry between its human protagonists, and improvements over the five Bay-directed installments, though criticism was aimed at its climax. The film has grossed over $278 million in the worldwide box office against a production budget of $195–200 million, making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2023.
15-3	"In December 2018, when asked about the future of the Transformers franchise, producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura stated that another big Transformers film ""would be produced"" and that it would be ""different than the ones that we've done before."" He described the process as more of an ""evolution,"" saying that there is more freedom to create and what they can do with it. After the success of Bumblebee that year, he said that the series would make some changes in tone and style, inspired by the film.[31] Bumblebee director Travis Knight said his goal was to return to his animation studio, Laika, though he acknowledged that he has a few ideas for a sequel.[32] John Cena expressed interest in reprising his role in a sequel.[33] Writer Christina Hodson said that ""[she] knows where [she wants] to go with the next one"".[34] In late January 2019, a sequel was announced.[35] In March, di Bonaventura confirmed they were developing a script for a Bumblebee sequel."
15-4	Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (Music from the Motion Picture) is the soundtrack to the 2023 film of the same name. The score was written by Jongnic Bontemps, who became the third composer in the series after Steve Jablonsky and Dario Marianelli.[1] Bontemps recorded the film score for nearly two years, beginning from late November 2021 to few weeks prior to the release, on May 2023. The soundtrack was released by Milan Records and Paramount Music on June 9, 2023, alongside the film.
15-5	The score references Jablonsky's themes from the Transformers (2007) and Vince DiCola's theme from The Transformers: The Movie (1986).[3] He felt that the main goal was to influence Jablonsky's score for the first five films directed by Michael Bay, but as the film was set after the events of Bumblebee (2018), which deviated from the timeline of the first five instalments and was the prequel in the franchise, he also needed to provide fresh music from the film. The story is set in 1990s at Brooklyn and Peru, with Bontemps handling the elements for the Brooklyn-based setting, while employed several prominent soloists from Latin America and Africa, for the Peruvian portions. The music received generally positive reviews from critics.
15-6	"Rescue Bots also did its own thing, opting for a rock/pop opening composed by the show's incidental musicians, husband and wife team Starr Parodi and Jeff Eden Fair. The lyrics, written by Nicole Dubuc and sung by Marianas Trench front-man Josh Ramsay, describe the show's premise. At the climax of the musical episode ""I Have Heard the Robots Singing"", the main cast sings a revamped version of the theme song. The show's sequel, Rescue Bots Academy, has a different, shorter and more dramatic theme to it. Unlike Rescue Bots, Rescue Bots Academy features a short roll call of the main cast partway through the song. Doug Califano composed the theme, with vocals by Zach Allen."
15-7	"The original, classic ""Generation 1"" theme tune by Ford Kinder and Anne Bryant, with its simple, iconic repetition of the brand's rhyming slogans, ""More than meets the eye,"" and ""robots in disguise,"" has formed the basis of most Western Transformers theme tunes. Accompanying the title sequence and being used as both the opening theme of the animated series and in the multitude of toy commercials over the years, it's pretty much burned into the mind of every thirty-to-forty something year old in the English-speaking western world, and maybe their parents as well. You say to someone, ""Transformers?"" and it's not unlikely that you'll have them jingle back ""Ro-bots in dis-guise!"" Seasons 1, 2 and 3 of the series feature their own distinct renditions of the theme tune. Season 2's version was mostly different but the tune and lyrics remain unchanged. Season 3's version is especially distinguished by the unusual ""Ah-aah!"" chant which is a chorus tune that runs throughout it, and being offbeat compared to those of earlier seasons, which suits Season 3's grim and sci fi orientated nature. (Season 4, having only three episodes, used the previous season's theme.) The original studio recording of the season 1 version of the theme, without the post-production processing and effects that were used for the broadcast version, can be found on the 2018 LP release Hasbro Studios Presents 80s TV Classics: Music From The Transformers."
15-8	"Transformers Animated continued this tradition with yet another new variation of the theme by Andy Sturmer and Sebastian Evans II, including an entirely new rhyming couplet, ""More than they appear/Justice, bolts, and gears!"" However, because the opening credits had to be shortened from one minute down to thirty seconds, this new verse had to be omitted from the final broadcast version of the opening. The full, uncut theme song is available on the DVD that comes in the Optimus Prime vs. Megatron - The Battle Begins 2-pack, and was available for download in mp3 format on Hasbro's website."
15-9	"`""The Transformers (Theme)"" is an extended version of the Transformers theme song written and recorded especially for The Transformers: The Movie. It is played over both the title sequence and closing credits of the movie, edited in both instances to fit the time allotted. The version used during the title sequence features only the intro, second chorus and outro. As such it includes only the original lyrics from the G1 cartoon's theme. For the credits, the song's play time is significantly extended by looping from the end of the guitar solo back into the first verse, albeit with said solo edited down to just a few bars the second time around."

15-11	The Transformers: Rise of the Beasts soundtrack featuring 90s hip-hop beats is out now – so, here’s the tracklist with all the songs in the movie as well as information on the score and how to stream both albums. Transformers’ toy line has spawned a massive media franchise, with the late 00s seeing the arrival of Michael Bay’s movie series. Though the love-it-or-hate-it Bayformers concluded with 2017’s The Last Knight, a reboot arrived the following year with the well-received Bumblebee. Rise of the Beasts serves as a sequel to the film, and is set in 1994 – seven years after the events of its predecessor. And with a ‘90s setting, it’s only fair that the movie gets a soundtrack to match. With Transformers: Rise of the Beasts arriving in cinemas this week, here’s a rundown of the movie’s soundtrack and score so you can queue up the songs to turn up to the maximal.
15-12	Paramount’s Transformers franchise was conceived by Michael Bay as a maximalist epic of crunching, crashing, morphing metal beasts and the humans caught in the metallic whirlwind of their drama. With director Steven Caple Jr. in the director’s chair for Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, the series now strives to balance the character and the spectacle in a fashion similar to director Travis Knight’s spinoff film Bumblebee, which was set in the 1980s and a little bit earthier and more human-centered. Caple Jr.’s new film, which soaks up the sights, sounds, and styles of the 1990s, benefits mightily from the adventurous yet elegant score from composer Jongnic Bontemps.
15-13	On the scoring stage at 20th Century-Fox studios in Burbank, composer Jongnic Bontemps is walking around in a “Transformers: The Movie” T-shirt – that’s the animated cartoon from 1986, not the $200-million summer blockbuster he’s just scored. “Violins, play a little softer,” he tells the musicians via intercom from the glass booth behind the stage. “It has to be emotional.” Later, after a rehearsal on a different cue, he tells the string players, “It needs to feel like a warm blanket.” Bontemps is making movie history. He has just spent two years writing the music for “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” the seventh in the big-screen franchise, and he’s supervising the recording of the final pieces of the score with a 74-piece orchestra. The film opens Friday.
15-14	Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows a planet eater out for a stone that will allow him to travel throughout space and time to find planets to consume. The ancient animal transformers protect the stone and have traveled to Earth to hide themselves and the stone. When autobots that support the planet eater arrive on Earth to find the stone the transformers and animal transformers will need to work together to protect the stone. This movie is directed by Steven Caple Jr. (Creed II) and stars Anthony Ramos (In the Heights), Dominique Fishback (Judas and the Black Messiah), Dean Scott Vazquez (In the Heights), Tobe Nwigwe (Mo) and Michael Kelly (Dawn of the Dead). This storyline was really compelling and interesting. It was tremendous watching the animal and car transformer worlds combine. The CGI and special effects were outstanding and every action scene is a 10/10. I really adored every fight. However, we didn't need the humans in this at all, and the action, dialogue and plot points involving Ramos and Fishback were painful. They are good actors whose performances weren't good here and felt out of place. It's time to move on from the humans needing to be the heroes in these storylines...because the Transformers, both good guys and bad guys, were awesome. Overall, this is a worthwhile addition to the Transformers series that I would strongly recommend. I would score this a 6/10.
15-15	"After being disappointed with Age of Extinction, loathing The Last Knight, and being one of the few that disliked Bumblebee, I went into this movie expecting it to be terrible. But I am ecstatic after watching the best Transformers movie since Dark of the Moon. I found myself smiling for most of the runtime. For the first time in years, I kept thinking ""Transformers are so damn cool."" There are so many beautiful shots with these CGI creations, so many moments to screenshot the image and frame it. The action is miles better than the last three entries. They fixed so many of the issues that plagued the last three movies. There are actual characters with motivations we understand, conflicts where we can see both sides of the argument. Even the Transformer characters are significantly more fleshed out. I felt for them. There is an actual story instead of nonsense to move the plot forward. You don't even have to turn your brain off to enjoy it. And the comedy actually works! I laughed more times than the previous three movies combined. This experience made me so happy, and I look forward to any future projects if this is the direction they're taking. It's a perfect example of how, if you do it right and create with care and passion, the result will be endlessly better."
15-16	MOVIE INFO Returning to the action and spectacle that have captured moviegoers around the world, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts will take audiences on a '90s globetrotting adventure with the Autobots and introduce a whole new faction of Transformer -- the Maximals -- to the existing battle on earth between Autobots and Decepticons.

15-17	Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (M, 127 mins) Directed by Steven Caple Jr.**** Transformers: Rise of the Beasts has pretty low stakes. The baddie of the film is a some sort of rogue god who is threatening to literally eat the Earth. But the film is set in 1994. And here we all are. So, y'know, I guess the good guys win in the end. Back in 1994, we are told, bad guy Unicron and his robot minions came to Earth, looking for a key that would unlock the universe and allow him to carry on eating planets wherever he found them. One half of the key is in New York – of course – where it has just been delivered to a lab at an East Side museum, hidden inside a supposed Egyptian statuette. Elena is an intern at the museum. When the mysterious statuette arrives, Elena knows there's more to it than meets the eye (lol). Meanwhile, across the East River, Noah is a young ex-soldier from Bushwick, desperate to pay his little brother's hospital bills, trying to steal a very pretty Porsche.
15-18	The seventh installment in the Transformers franchise arrived in cinemas last week, serving as both a sequel to 2018's Bumblee and a prequel to the five Michael Bay films. As has often been the case with this franchise, reviews of the film have been decidedly mixed – but that's not stopped it from performing strongly at the global box office, opening to higher figures than each of the last two entries in the franchise. One of the things that sets Transformers: Rise of the Beasts apart from any of the other films is its setting, with the action largely unfolding in 1994 following a brief prehistoric opening segment. That setting allowed the film's creative team to include a soundtrack featuring many classic hip-hop hits from the decade, with Wu-Tang Clan, Nas, and Notorious B.I.G. among the big names to feature alongside an original track from star Tobe Nwigwe.
15-19	"Transformers: Dark of the Moon – The Album is a compilation album of various artists music from the 2011 live-action Transformers: Dark of the Moon film. The first official single from the album is the radio edit version of ""Iridescent"" by Linkin Park. The second single released for the film is ""Monster"" by Paramore. The third single released for the film is ""All That You Are"" by Goo Goo Dolls. The score was released digitally 10 days after the album. U2 song North Star was used in the movie."
16-0	At COMPUTEX 2023, NVIDIA announced NVIDIA DGX GH200, which marks another breakthrough in GPU-accelerated computing to power the most demanding giant AI workloads. In addition to describing critical aspects of the NVIDIA DGX GH200 architecture, this post discusses how NVIDIA Base Command enables rapid deployment, accelerates the onboarding of users, and simplifies system management. The unified memory programming model of GPUs has been the cornerstone of various breakthroughs in complex accelerated computing applications over the last 7 years. In 2016, NVIDIA introduced NVLink technology and the Unified Memory Programming model with CUDA-6, designed to increase the memory available to GPU-accelerated workloads. Since then, the core of every DGX system is a GPU complex on a baseboard interconnected with NVLink in which each GPU can access the other’s memory at NVLink speed. Many such DGX with GPU complexes are interconnected with high-speed networking to form larger supercomputers such as the NVIDIA Selene supercomputer. Yet an emerging class of giant, trillion-parameter AI models will require either several months to train or cannot be solved even on today’s best supercomputers.
16-1	To empower the scientists in need of an advanced platform that can solve these extraordinary challenges, NVIDIA paired NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip with the NVLink Switch System, uniting up to 256 GPUs in an NVIDIA DGX GH200 system. In the DGX GH200 system, 144 terabytes of memory will be accessible to the GPU shared memory programming model at high speed over NVLink. Compared to a single NVIDIA DGX A100 320 GB system, NVIDIA DGX GH200 provides nearly 500x more memory to the GPU shared memory programming model over NVLink, forming a giant data center-sized GPU. NVIDIA DGX GH200 is the first supercomputer to break the 100-terabyte barrier for memory accessible to GPUs over NVLink.
16-2	NVIDIA DGX GH200 system architecture NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip and NVLink Switch System are the building blocks of NVIDIA DGX GH200 architecture. NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip combines the Grace and Hopper architectures using NVIDIA NVLink-C2C to deliver a CPU + GPU coherent memory model. The NVLink Switch System, powered by the fourth generation of NVLink technology, extends NVLink connection across superchips to create a seamless, high-bandwidth, multi-GPU system. Each NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip in NVIDIA DGX GH200 has 480 GB LPDDR5 CPU memory, at eighth of the power per GB, compared with DDR5 and 96 GB of fast HBM3. NVIDIA Grace CPU and Hopper GPU are interconnected with NVLink-C2C, providing 7x more bandwidth than PCIe Gen5 at one-fifth the power. NVLink Switch System forms a two-level, non-blocking, fat-tree NVLink fabric to fully connect 256 Grace Hopper Superchips in a DGX GH200 system. Every GPU in DGX GH200 can access the memory of other GPUs and extended GPU memory of all NVIDIA Grace CPUs at 900 GBps. Compute baseboards hosting Grace Hopper Superchips are connected to the NVLink Switch System using a custom cable harness for the first layer of NVLink fabric. LinkX cables extend the connectivity in the second layer of NVLink fabric.
16-3	"Nvidia unveiled its latest party trick at Computex in Taipei: stitching together 256 Grace-Hopper superchips into an ""AI supercomputer"" using nothing but NVLink. The kit, dubbed the DGX GH200, is being offered as a single system tuned for memory-intensive AI models for natural language processing (NPM) recommender systems, and graph neural networks. In a press briefing ahead of CEO Jensen Huang's keynote, executives compared the GH200 to the biz's recently launched DGX H100 server, claiming up to 500x higher memory. However the two are nothing alike. The DGX H100 is an 8U system with dual Intel Xeons and eight H100 GPUs and about as many NICs. The DGX GH200, is a 24-rack cluster built on an all-Nvidia architecture — so not exactly comparable."
16-4	Teeing off an AI-heavy slate of announcements for NVIDIA, the company has confirmed that their Grace Hopper “superchip” has entered full production. The combination of a Grace CPU and Hopper H100 GPU, Grace Hopper is designed to be NVIDIA’s answer for customers who need a more tightly integrated CPU + GPU solution for their workloads – particularly for AI models. In the works for a few years now, Grace Hopper is NVIDIA’s efforts to leverage both their existing strength in the GPU space and newfound efforts in the CPU space to deliver a semi-integrated CPU/GPU product unlike anything their top-line competitors offer. With NVIDIA’s traditional dominance in the GPU space, the company has essentially been working backwards, combining their GPU technology with other types of processors (CPUs, DPUs, etc) in order to access markets that benefit from GPU acceleration, but where fully discrete GPUs may not be the best solution.
16-5	NVIDIA CEO Jensen Hiang made a string of announcements during his Computex keynote, including details about the company’s next DGX supercomputer. Given where the industry is clearly heading, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the DGX GH200 is largely about helping companies develop generative AI models. The supercomputer uses a new NVLink Switch System to enable 256 GH200 Grace Hopper superchips to act as a single GPU (each of the chips has an Arm-based Grace CPU and an H100 Tensor Core GPU). This, according to NVIDIA, allows the DGX GH200 to deliver 1 exaflop of performance and to have 144 terabytes of shared memory. The company says that's nearly 500 times as much memory as you'd find in a single DGX A100 system.
16-6	When nVidia announced that it had stitched 256 Grace-Hopper superchips together to make the DGX GH200 at Computex in Taipei, the reasons behind it were all driven by one thing: the increasing demands of AI. It's been pretty clear for a while that nVidia's focus of late has been on AI. It dominates datacenter scale AI by a such a large margin that it's easy to forget that there are any other companies providing products for datacenter scale AI solutions. It also explains why nVidia doesn't seem to be particularly worried about the new AMD and Intel GPUs, even though they're gaining market share from nVidia. Several years ago, nVidia acquired Mellanox, a company that makes high performance networking and interconnect solutions. It used that technology to create a revolutionary datacenter GPU, the A100 AI accelerator, so powerful that a single rack module could replace an entire datacenter. Its successor the A200 was nearly as big a boost. Both however shared one limitation that is common to GPUs: memory capacity. While it seems like GPUs with 48 or even 96GB of memory have a lot of memory, that hasn't come even close to keeping up with the growth in the size of AI datasets. To understand why this matters, and why the company felt the need to create the DGX GH200, first we need a basic understanding of how AI works.
16-7	Nvidia has once again proven itself to be at the cutting edge of AI technology, so how does comparing the DGX GH200 vs DGX H100 look? Nvidia’s announcement of their new and hugely powerful GH200 supercomputer has brought even more excitement to the world of AI. This new system can offer potentially 500 times the memory for building AI models compared to their DGX H100 and has already garnered interest from the likes of Google, Microsoft and Meta. This is because the power it brings offers the chance to push AI to the next level, beyond even the likes of the recent PaLM 2 and potentially GPT-5.
16-8	VAST Data and Nvidia form SuperPOD squad By Chris Mellor -May 17, 2023 VAST Data says its all-QLC flash file storage has been certified as an Nvidia SuperPOD data store. Nvidia’s SuperPOD houses 20 to 140 DGX A100 AI-focused GPU servers and uses its InfiniBand HDR (200Gbps) network connect. The DGX A100 features eight A100 Tensor Core GPUs, 640GB of GPU memory and dual AMD Rome 7742 CPUs in a 6RU box. It also supports BlueField-2 DPUs to accelerate IO. The box provides up to 5 petaFLOPS of AI performance, meaning 100 petaFLOPS in a SuperPOD with 20 of them.
16-9	This is perhaps one of the biggest pieces of hardware. NVIDIA has a BlueField-3 DPU paired with an NVIDIA A100 GPU in a massive card. One way to look at the card is that it is “simply” an accelerator card. The other way to look at the NVIDIA AX800 is it is a server with 16x Arm cores, 32GB of memory and 40GB of storage, an ASPEED BMC, an A100 GPU, and over 400Gbps of total networking, plus NVLink on a single card. NVIDIA AX800 High-End Arm Server on a PCIe Card The new NVIDIA AX800 combines two main components: A NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPU A NVIDIA A100 80GB Both of these are combined into a single dual-slot card with a 350W TDP and a minimum of only 150W TDP. This is up from the 300W of the previous generation NVIDIA A100X, but while the GPU remains the same, we get a much faster DPU.
16-10	AMD has officially unveiled its Instinct MI300 APUs which combine Zen 4 CPU cores with CDNA 3 GPU cores with up to 153 Billion transistors & 192 GB HBM3 memory. AMD Leads The Industry In Offering The First Exascale Instinct MI300 APU: Up To 24 Zen 4 Cores, GPU-Only MI300X With Up To 192 GB HBM3 Memory All three chipmakers, AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA, are currently in the race to offer the world's first CPU and CPU combo. Intel's offering was going to be Falcon Shores which was going to combine an x86 CPU with a leading-edge GPU but those plans didn't come to fruition and the Chipzilla has delayed the project for the foreseeable future.
16-11	Last May, after we had done a deep dive on the “Hopper” H100 GPU accelerator architecture and as we were trying to reckon what Nvidia could charge for the PCI-Express and SXM5 variants of the GH100, we said that Nvidia needed to launch a Hopper-Hopper superchip. The performance of the PCI-Express variant of the chip – and the expected gap in pricing – was such that we thought Nvidia might be tempted to repeat its history. The “Kepler” K80 twofer GPU card, launched way back in 2014, came out because Nvidia was so focused on the exploding AI market that it didn’t put enough 64-bit floating point math in the follow-on “Maxwell” GPU, and the stopgap was to just put two K40s on a single card and go for the density play with a bit of a price break. (You can do that with workloads that scale out.)
16-12	That the H100-NVL has moved the PCI-Express version over to full HBM3 stacked memory, up from HBM2e memory running in the single-wide PCI-Express version of the H100 accelerator launched last year. This quadruple-wide card has 94 GB of memory per GPU, up from 80 GB per GPU with both the PCI-Express and SXM5 versions (which add NVLink interconnects out of the GPUs to hook in an eight-way NVSwitch NUMA complex across the GPUs in a single node.) On the 80 GB HBM devices, there are five out of six possible HBM stacks operating, and they have 16 GB each. (The sixth is dead to increase yield.) With the H100-NVL twofer, the memory is not only boosted by 20 percent to 94 GB per GPU, but the memory speed on the HBM3 stacks is also goosed by 33 percent, yielding 3.9 TB/sec of bandwidth per GPU, which is twice the 1.95 TB/sec that the double-wide H100 PCI-Express 5.0 card offered last year with its 80 GB of HBM2e memory.
16-13	Fast Technology News on May 29th, AI is the current hot spot, and now it has become the most concerned part of NVIDIA. Today, at the keynote speech at the Taipei Computer Show, NVIDIA released the large-memory DGX GH200 supercomputer for AI. The system is equipped with 256 Grace Hopper chips, a total of 18,000 CPU cores, and 144TB of memory, which is 500 times higher than before. AI computing has higher requirements on memory capacity,Therefore, DGX GH200 connects 256 Grace Hooper super chips through the latest NVLink, NVLink Switch and other technologies to achieve extremely exaggerated performance and memory.
16-14	NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU delivers unprecedented acceleration at every scale to power the world’s highest-performing elastic data centers for AI, data analytics, and HPC. Powered by the NVIDIA Ampere Architecture, A100 is the engine of the NVIDIA data center platform. A100 provides up to 20X higher performance over the prior generation and can be partitioned into seven GPU instances to dynamically adjust to shifting demands. The A100 80GB debuts the world’s fastest memory bandwidth at over 2 terabytes per second (TB/s) to run the largest models and datasets.
16-15	What is NVIDIA DGX? DGX is a line of servers and workstations built by NVIDIA, which can run large, demanding machine learning and deep learning workloads on GPUs. DGX provides a massive amount of computing power—between 1-5 PetaFLOPS in one DGX system. It also provides advanced technology for interlinking GPUs and enabling massive parallelization across thousands of GPU cores. Beyond the powerful hardware they provide, DGX systems come out of the box with an optimized operating system and a complete pre-integrated environment for running deep learning projects. They provide a containerized software architecture that lets data scientists easily deploy the deep learning frameworks and management tools they need with minimal setup or configuration.
16-16	NVIDIA DGX-1—First Generation DGX Server NVIDIA DGX-1 is an integrated deep learning workstation with a large computing capacity, which can be used to run demanding deep learning workloads. It provides GPU computing power of 1 PetaFLOPS (1 quadrillion floating-point operations per second). It provides the following hardware features: GPUs 8x NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU Memory Total of 256 GB CPU Dual 20 Core Intel Xeon E5-2698 v4 2.2GHz CUDA Cores 40,960 Tensor Cores 5,120 Power 3500W System RAM 512 GB 2133 MHz DDR4 RDIMM Networking Dual 10 GB Ethernet Operating System Canonical Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
16-17	NVIDIA DGX A100 The Challenge of Scaling Enterprise AI Every business needs to transform using artificial intelligence (AI), not only to survive, but to thrive in challenging times. However, the enterprise requires a platform for AI infrastructure that improves upon traditional approaches, which historically involved slow compute architectures that were siloed by analytics, training, and inference workloads. The old approach created complexity, drove up costs, constrained speed of scale, and was not ready for modern AI. Enterprises, developers, data scientists, and researchers need a new platform that unifies all AI workloads, simplifying infrastructure and accelerating ROI. The Universal System for Every AI Workload DGX A100 sets a new bar for compute density, packing 5 petaFLOPS of AI performance into a 6U form factor, replacing legacy compute infrastructure with a single, unified system. DGX A100 also offers the unprecedented ability to deliver fine-grained allocation of computing power, using the Multi-Instance GPU capability in the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU, which enables administrators to assign resources that are right-sized for specific workloads. This ensures that the largest and most complex jobs are supported, along with the simplest and smallest. Running the DGX software stack with optimized software from NGC, the combination of dense compute power and complete workload flexibility make DGX A100 an ideal choice for both single node deployments and large scale Slurm and Kubernetes clusters deployed with NVIDIA DeepOps.
16-18	Nvidia has just announced a new supercomputer that may change the future of AI. The DGX GH200, equipped with nearly 500 times more memory than the systems we’re familiar with now, will soon fall into the hands of Google, Meta, and Microsoft. The goal? Revolutionizing generative AI, recommender systems, and data processing on a scale we’ve never seen before. Are language models like GPT going to benefit, and what will that mean for regular users?
16-19	Let’s circle back to the 1 exaflop figure and break it down a little. One exaflop equals a quintillion floating-point operations per second (FLOPs). For comparison, Nvidia’s RTX 4090 can hit around 100 teraflops (TFLOPs) when overclocked. A TFLOP equals one trillion floating-point operations per second. The difference is staggering, but of course, the RTX 4090 is not a data center GPU. The DGX GH200, on the other hand, integrates a substantial number of these high-performance GPUs that don’t belong anywhere near a consumer PC. Nvidia's Grace Hopper superchip. Nvidia The computer is powered by Nvidia’s GH200 Grace Hopper superchips. There are 256 of them in total, which, thanks to Nvidia’s NVLink interconnect technology, are all able to work together as a unified system, essentially creating one massive GPU. The GH200 superchips used here also don’t need a traditional PCIe connection between the CPU and the GPU. Nvidia says that they’re already equipped with an ARM-based Nvidia Grace CP,U as well as an H100 Tensor Core GPU. Nvidia’s got some fancy chip interconnects going on here too, this time using the NVLink-C2C. As a result, the bandwidth between the processor and the graphics card is said to be significantly improved (up to 7 times) and more power-efficient (up to 5 times).
17-0	Introducing PyTorch 2.0, our first steps toward the next generation 2-series release of PyTorch. Over the last few years we have innovated and iterated from PyTorch 1.0 to the most recent 1.13 and moved to the newly formed PyTorch Foundation, part of the Linux Foundation. PyTorch’s biggest strength beyond our amazing community is that we continue as a first-class Python integration, imperative style, simplicity of the API and options. PyTorch 2.0 offers the same eager-mode development and user experience, while fundamentally changing and supercharging how PyTorch operates at compiler level under the hood. We are able to provide faster performance and support for Dynamic Shapes and Distributed. Below you will find all the information you need to better understand what PyTorch 2.0 is, where it’s going and more importantly how to get started today (e.g., tutorial, requirements, models, common FAQs). There is still a lot to learn and develop but we are looking forward to community feedback and contributions to make the 2-series better and thank you all who have made the 1-series so successful.
17-1	by Team PyTorch We are excited to announce the release of PyTorch® 2.0 which we highlighted during the PyTorch Conference on 12/2/22! PyTorch 2.0 offers the same eager-mode development and user experience, while fundamentally changing and supercharging how PyTorch operates at compiler level under the hood with faster performance and support for Dynamic Shapes and Distributed. This next-generation release includes a Stable version of Accelerated Transformers (formerly called Better Transformers); Beta includes torch.compile as the main API for PyTorch 2.0, the scaled_dot_product_attention function as part of torch.nn.functional, the MPS backend, functorch APIs in the torch.func module; and other Beta/Prototype improvements across various inferences, performance and training optimization features on GPUs and CPUs. For a comprehensive introduction and technical overview of torch.compile, please visit the 2.0 Get Started page. Along with 2.0, we are also releasing a series of beta updates to the PyTorch domain libraries, including those that are in-tree, and separate libraries including TorchAudio, TorchVision, and TorchText. An update for TorchX is also being released as it moves to community supported mode. More details can be found in this library blog. This release is composed of over 4,541 commits and 428 contributors since 1.13.1. We want to sincerely thank our dedicated community for your contributions. As always, we encourage you to try these out and report any issues as we improve 2.0 and the overall 2-series this year. Summary: torch.compile is the main API for PyTorch 2.0, which wraps your model and returns a compiled model. It is a fully additive (and optional) feature and hence 2.0 is 100% backward compatible by definition. As an underpinning technology of torch.compile, TorchInductor with Nvidia and AMD GPUs will rely on OpenAI Triton deep learning compiler to generate performant code and hide low level hardware details. OpenAI Triton-generated kernels achieve performance that’s on par with hand-written kernels and specialized cuda libraries such as cublas. Accelerated Transformers introduce high-performance support for training and inference using a custom kernel architecture for scaled dot product attention (SPDA). The API is integrated with torch.compile() and model developers may also use the scaled dot product attention kernels directly by calling the new scaled_dot_product_attention() operator. Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) backend provides GPU accelerated PyTorch training on Mac platforms with added support for Top 60 most used ops, bringing coverage to over 300 operators. Amazon AWS optimizes the PyTorch CPU inference on AWS Graviton3 based C7g instances. PyTorch 2.0 improves inference performance on Graviton compared to the previous releases, including improvements for Resnet50 and Bert. New prototype features and technologies across TensorParallel, DTensor, 2D parallel, TorchDynamo, AOTAutograd, PrimTorch and TorchInductor.
17-2	After months of highlighting the features at the PyTorch Conference, the new release of PyTorch 2.0 is finally here. The new version offers the same experience while supercharging the compiler abilities including support for Dynamic Shapes and Distributed. The push is completely towards making it more “Pythonic”. The release also includes a stable version of Accelerated Transformers. The Beta also includes torch.compile as the main API for PyTorch 2.0, which wraps the model, returning it in a compiled mode. Being fully additive, the new version is also fully backward compatible. The focus is the performance. To learn more about the release in detail, click here.
17-3	Ok so the focus of PyTorch 2.0 is speed, how much faster is it actually? The PyTorch team ran tests across 163 open-source models from Hugging Face Transformers, timm (PyTorch Image Models) and TorchBench (a curated set of popular code bases from across GitHub). This is important because unless PyTorch 2.0 is faster on models people actually use, it’s not faster. Using a mixture of AMP (automatic mixed precision or float16) training and float32 precision (higher precision requires more compute) the PyTorch team found that torch.compile() provides an average speedup of 43% in training on a NVIDIA A100 GPU. Or 38% on timm, 76% on TorchBench and 52% on Hugging Face Transformers.
17-4	"1. Setup environment & install Pytorch 2.0 Our first step is to install PyTorch 2.0 and the Hugging Face Libraries, including transformers and datasets. # Install PyTorch 2.0 with cuda 11.7 !pip install ""torch>=2.0"" --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117 --upgrade --quiet Additionally, we are installing the latest version of transformers from the main git branch, which includes the native integration of PyTorch 2.0 into the Trainer. # Install transformers and dataset !pip install ""transformers==4.27.1"" ""datasets==2.9.0"" ""accelerate==0.17.1"" ""evaluate==0.4.0"" tensorboard scikit-learn # Install git-fls for pushing model and logs to the hugging face hub !sudo apt-get install git-lfs --yes This example will use the Hugging Face Hub as a remote model versioning service. To push our model to the Hub, you must register on the Hugging Face. If you already have an account, you can skip this step. After you have an account, we will use the login util from the huggingface_hub package to log into our account and store our token (access key) on the disk. from huggingface_hub import login login( token="""", # ADD YOUR TOKEN HERE add_to_git_credential=True )"
17-5	"PyTorch 2.0.0 is now GA in the last 24 hours and has the cuDNN v8.7 fix if you get the correct version of it. In other words, no more file copying hacks. However, there are two versions of 2.0.0. torch==2.0.0+cu117 Still uses cuDNN 8.5 and torch==2.0.0+cu118 Uses cuDNN 8.7 Also the default repo's for ""pip install torch"" only has the cu117 version. Thus you need to use the extra url thing as follows: pip3 install clean-fid numba numpy torch==2.0.0+cu118 torchvision --force-reinstall --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 Danger danger... If you let A1111 install your xformers it will downgrade your pytorch. I missed this when I first created this post because I always built xformers to install it on Linux. Thus I got an xformers compatible with torch 2.0. Either don't use xformers because sdp seems to work just as well or you'll need to get a xformers for torch 2.0 and don't ask me where to download it from. I don't know."
17-6	If you have recently bought a new laptop with Windows 11 installed on it and are interested in doing some deep learning using PyTorch then you have come to the right place. In this article, I will give a step-by-step guide on how to install PyTorch with GPU support. My laptop is HP Omen 16 with RTX 3050 graphics card. One of the pre-requisite is that you need to have “conda” installed in your system. You get this when installing python using “Anaconda”. Please check the link to install “Anaconda”
17-7	"Both TensorFlow and PyTorch offer useful abstractions that ease the development of models by reducing boilerplate code. They differ because PyTorch has a more ""pythonic"" approach and is object-oriented, while TensorFlow offers a variety of options. PyTorch is used for many deep learning projects today, and its popularity is increasing among AI researchers, although of the three main frameworks, it is the least popular. Trends show that this may change soon. When researchers want flexibility, debugging capabilities, and short training duration, they choose PyTorch. It runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Thanks to its well-documented framework and abundance of trained models and tutorials, TensorFlow is the favorite tool of many industry professionals and researchers. TensorFlow offers better visualization, which allows developers to debug better and track the training process. PyTorch, however, provides only limited visualization. TensorFlow also beats PyTorch in deploying trained models to production, thanks to the TensorFlow Serving framework. PyTorch offers no such framework, so developers need to use Django or Flask as a back-end server. In the area of data parallelism, PyTorch gains optimal performance by relying on native support for asynchronous execution through Python. However, with TensorFlow, you must manually code and optimize every operation run on a specific device to allow distributed training. In summary, you can replicate everything from PyTorch in TensorFlow; you just need to work harder at it. If you’re just starting to explore deep learning, you should learn PyTorch first due to its popularity in the research community. However, if you’re familiar with machine learning and deep learning and focused on getting a job in the industry as soon as possible, learn TensorFlow first."
17-8	More Pythonic PyTorch 2 Released Written by Alex Denham Thursday, 30 March 2023 PyTorch 2.0 has been released with fundamental changes to the way it works at the compiler level, faster performance, and support for Dynamic Shapes and Distributed. PyTorch is an optimized tensor library for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs that until now has mainly been developed by Meta AI. It aims to offer a replacement for NumPy that makes use of the power of GPUs, while providing a deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed. pytorch The new release includes a stable version of Accelerated Transformers (formerly called Better Transformers); and torch.compile, a feature that improves PyTorch performance and starts the move for parts of PyTorch from C++ back into Python. torch.compile is an optional and additive feature. Torch.compile makes use of several new technologies – TorchDynamo, AOTAutograd, PrimTorch and TorchInductor.
17-9	In the release of Python 2.0, contributions from Intel using Intel Extension for PyTorch , oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) and additional support for Intel CPUs enable developers to optimize inference and training performance for artificial intelligence (AI). As part of the PyTorch 2.0 compilation stack, the TorchInductor CPU backend optimization by Intel Extension for PyTorch and PyTorch ATen CPU achieved up to 1.7 times faster FP32 inference performance when benchmarked with TorchBench, HuggingFace and timm. This update brings notable performance improvements to graph compilation over the PyTorch eager mode. Other optimizations include: Improved message-passing between adjacent neural network nodes to support graph neural network in PyTorch Geometric (PyG) for enhanced inference and performance training on Intel CPUs. New x86 quantization backend – a combination of FBGEMM (Facebook General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication) and oneDNN backends – replaces FBGEMM as the default quantization backend for x86 CPU platforms to enable better end-to-end int8 inference performance. Extended use of oneDNN with oneDNN Graph API to maximize efficient code generation on AI hardware by automatically identifying the graph partitions to be accelerated through fusion. BFloat16 and Float32 data types are supported and only inference workloads can be optimized; BF16 is only optimized on machines with AVX512_BF16 ISA support.
17-10	Artificial intelligence development startup Lightning AI Inc. today announced the general availability of PyTorch Lightning 2.0, an open-source AI framework that’s used by thousands of organizations to train and scale up machine learning models. PyTorch Lightning is one of the most popular machine learning development tools, with an average of 4 million downloads per month, thanks to the way it simplifies many manual tasks involved in creating AI-powered software. Building an AI application means not only creating a neural network, but also setting up and managing the infrastructure it runs on. Doing so involves lots of manual work and is very time-consuming, so developers can save time by using PyTorch Lightning to automate much of it. Another task that PyTorch Lightning simplifies is AI training. It does so using a combination of large numbers of processors and tools that make it easier for developers to evaluate the speed of their neural networks and troubleshoot any issues that come up. Another benefit of PyTorch Lightning is that it reduces the amount of custom code developers must write to use multiple types of chips, such as graphics processing units and central processing units, in their ML training projects. Lightning AI sells a commercial version of PyTorch Lightning that makes it simpler for enterprises to deploy and use. It also provides prepackaged AI applications for common use cases, which can be used by customers as blueprints for their own, custom applications. With the launch of PyTorch Lightning 2.0, Lightning AI said, it’s introducing a stable application programming interface, more powerful features with a smaller footprint, and tools that make it easier to read and debug. It’s also introducing Lightning Fabric, which is a new library that gives developers more control over the AI training process, with features like callbacks and checkpoints and support for reinforcement learning, active learning and transformers.
17-11	PyTorch got its start at Facebook (now known as Meta) in 2016 with the 1.0 release debuting in 2018. In September 2022, Meta moved the PyTorch project to the new PyTorch Foundation, which is operated by the Linux Foundation. Today, PyTorch developers took the next major step forward for PyTorch, announcing the first experimental release of PyTorch 2.0. The new release promises to help accelerate ML training and development, while still maintaining backward-compatibility with existing PyTorch application code.
17-12	Soumith Chintala is a creator and the lead of Facebook's core machine learning tool, PyTorch. He says the extreme popularity of today's dominant AI technique may have unintended consequences. Increasingly specialized hardware for Transformers may make it harder for new techniques to catch on. Some of today's most popular emerging AI tools, such as OpenAI's text generation tool GPT-3, were made possible by an AI technique called Transformers. Notably, Transformers first hit the scene in 2017, soon finding a home in popular AI programming frameworks TensorFlow (backed by Google) and PyTorch (started at Facebook). And in an industry where machine learning tools and techniques are evolving at a blistering pace, a half-decade might as well be half a century. The enduring popularity of the Transformers model may prove to be a double-edged sword, warns Soumith Chintala, a creator of PyTorch and a distinguished engineer at Meta, Facebook's parent company.
17-13	A binary classification problem is one where the goal is to predict a discrete value where there are just two possibilities. For example, you might want to predict the gender (male or female) of a person based on their age, state where they live, annual income and political leaning (conservative, moderate, liberal). Previous articles in Visual Studio Magazine have explained binary classification using PyTorch. But machine learning with deep neural techniques has advanced quickly. This article updates binary classification techniques and best practices based on experience over the past two years. A good way to see where this article is headed is to take a look at the screenshot of a demo program in Figure 1. The demo begins by loading a 200-item file of training data and a 40-item set of test data. Each tab-delimited line represents a person. The fields are gender (male = 0, female = 1), age, state of residence, annual income and politics type. The goal is to predict gender from age, state, income and political leaning.

17-15	by Team PyTorch In September 2022, we welcomed PyTorch to the Linux Foundation from Meta, which formed the PyTorch Foundation with founding members AMD, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google, Meta, Microsoft, and NVIDIA. Since then, we’ve seen significant growth, including a 39% increase in commits across all repositories, 27% increase of unique contributors, and a 12% increase community contributions – all in the last 90 days! We’re grateful to our founding members for their support to move the foundation forward. Today, we’re announcing that membership is now open to join the PyTorch Foundation. As a member of the PyTorch Foundation, you’ll have access to resources that allow you to be stewards of stable, secure, and long-lasting codebases. You can collaborate on training and certification programs, local and regional events, open source developer tooling, academic research, and guides to help new users and contributors have a productive experience. The PyTorch Foundation’s goal is to help end users navigate the PyTorch ecosystem, recruit talent, and adopt PyTorch and support open source AI technologies successfully.
17-16	by Felix Marty, Younes Belkada, Hamid Shojanazeri As part of PyTorch 2.0 release, an accelerated implementation of the attention mechanism as part of the “Better Transformer” project (and known in PyTorch as Accelerated Transformers) has been added natively into PyTorch as torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention. This implementation leverages fused kernels from FlashAttention and Memory-efficient attention, and supports both training and inference. We also release a notebook showcasing an example of this integration here After seeing 20-30% speedups at inference for diffusion models, we went ahead and implemented an integration with 🤗 Transformers models through the 🤗 Optimum library. Similar to the previous integration for encoder models, the integration replaces modules from Transformers with efficient implementations that use torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention. The usage is as follow:

The effort that has paid dividends, with the beta of PyTorch 2.0 going into preview in December 2022. PyTorch 2.0 benefits from 428 different contributors that provided new code and capabilities to the open source effort. Performance is a primary focus for PyTorch 2.0 and one that developers have not been shy to promote. In fact, one of the key new features is Accelerated Transformers, formerly known as “Better Transformers.” These are are at the heart of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI, enabling models to make connections between different concepts.
17-18	"The maintainers of the PyTorch package have warned users who have installed the nightly builds of the library between December 25, 2022, and December 30, 2022, to uninstall and download the latest versions following a dependency confusion attack. ""PyTorch-nightly Linux packages installed via pip during that time installed a dependency, torchtriton, which was compromised on the Python Package Index (PyPI) code repository and ran a malicious binary,"" the PyTorch team said in an alert over the weekend. PyTorch, analogous to Keras and TensorFlow, is an open source Python-based machine learning framework that was originally developed by Meta Platforms. The PyTorch team said that it became aware of the malicious dependency on December 30, 4:40 p.m. GMT. The supply chain attack entailed uploading the malware-laced copy of a legitimate dependency named torchtriton to the Python Package Index (PyPI) code repository."
17-19	Takeaways PyTorch, one of the leading community-driven AI research frameworks, is moving to a new, independent PyTorch Foundation that will be part of the Linux Foundation. The PyTorch Foundation will democratize access to state-of-the-art AI tools, libraries and other components to accelerate progress in AI. Meta will continue to invest in PyTorch and use it as our primary framework for AI research and production applications at the company. Since 2016, when we partnered with the AI community to create the PyTorch framework for AI research, open collaboration has been essential to its success. With thousands of contributors who have built more than 150,000 projects on it, PyTorch has become one of the leading platforms for research and production across the AI community. Today, Mark Zuckerberg announced that the project will transition to a newly launched PyTorch Foundation, which will be part of the nonprofit Linux Foundation, a technology consortium whose core mission is the collaborative development of open-source software. The creation of the PyTorch Foundation ensures that decisions will be made in a transparent and open manner by a diverse group of board members for many years to come. The governing body will be composed of representatives from AMD, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Meta, Microsoft Azure and Nvidia, with the intention to expand further over time. Video Player
18-0	The Dark Flash in 2023's The Flash would seemingly be inspired more by the Reverse Flash from DC's New 52 reboot than the likes of Eobard Thawne or Hunter Zolomon. Created by Francis Manapul and Brian Buccelatto, this Reverse Flash was Daniel West, the criminal brother of Iris West. Debuting in The Flash #0 (by Buccelatto and Manapul), he was accidentally exposed to a Speed Force battery. This gave him advanced powers comparable to The Flash, allowing him to go back in time and try to kill his abusive father. The debris he would collect on his body throughout his journey through time would also become a sort of Speed Force armor for him, with its rusted appearance giving it a reddish black hue. Upon Daniel's defeat, Iris would make it clear that she had come to terms with their past and saw no need to rewrite it.
18-1	"This is similar to the development of both Barry Allen and his villainous younger counterpart, with the armored visuals of Daniel West/Reverse Flash and Dark Flash being very close. Dark Flash arguably also has elements of Black Flash from the comics, with that villain being a sort of Speed Force wraith/Grim Reaper. Given how Dark Flash essentially haunts Barry as he traverse the Speed Force in the movie, this amalgam role is very similar. It is intriguing that Daniel West was chosen as a ""source"" instead of Thawne given his veritable irrelevance. He hasn't been used in the comics in years, namely due to his having died as a member of the Suicide Squad. At the same time, his juxtaposed storyline is far more personal and worthy of a film than Thawne's petty, amorphous (and many times badly written) quest for revenge. It's definitely a darker shade of the Reverse Flash, but it's also a better one."
18-2	In the film, the main bad guy isn’t the Kryptonian General Zod, as early trailers might make you believe. The “Big Bad” of the film is none other than Barry Allen himself. Well, a version of him, that is. In the film, we saw a darkly clad being tossing adult Barry out into his own past as he races through time. He had a bigger plan in mind, which was to make the college-age Barry of 2013 into the being that he would become. A “Dark Flash.” We should note, this character is never called that by name in the film. However, the McFarlane Toys figure is labeled as “Dark Flash.” So we think that’s official enough.
18-3	Of course, Dark Flash is not the only villain in the film. General Zod (Michael Shannon) is our secondary bad guy, who is invading Earth just as he did in Man of Steel. Like Zack Snyder’s 2013 film, Zod is looking to recreate Krypton on Earth using something called the codex, something Jor-El stored inside his infant son. And in this timeline, Zod murdered baby Kal-El when his pod was diverted from Earth. Because in this universe, it is Supergirl/Kara Zor-El who has the codex in her cell structure. In Man of Steel, Zod and his Kryptonian army arrive on a US Military base in the desert, where a battle with this newly formed Justice League, made of Keaton Batman, Supergirl, and both Flashes ensues. Despite their best efforts, the League falls under the might of Zod’s forces. If adult Barry had not restored the timeline to the version where his mother died, Zod would have terraformed Earth into New Krypton, killing billions. Hopefully, if we ever get a Flash sequel, or reboot, we get some of Flash’s iconic rogues from the comics. They are long overdue for their cinematic debut. The Flash is in theaters now.
18-4	The Flash release date is racing towards the finish line, and the new movie is one of the most exciting DCU films in years as it looks set to bring an end to the SnyderVerse and usher in James Gunn’s reign as franchise boss. More than that, though, early reactions to The Flash have already hailed it as one of the best movies of the year, with fans being delighted by the return of Keaton’s Batman in a cinematic adaptation of Flashpoint. We know Keaton’s Batman will be teaming up with Barry Allen (x2) and Supergirl but who will they be fighting, and who is the movie villain in The Flash?
18-5	The Flash is a 2023 American superhero film based on the DC character of the same name. Produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, DC Studios, Double Dream, and the Disco Factory, and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures,[6] it is the 13th installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The film is directed by Andy Muschietti from a screenplay by Christina Hodson and stars Ezra Miller as Barry Allen / The Flash alongside Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon, Ron Livingston, Maribel Verdú, Kiersey Clemons, Antje Traue, and Michael Keaton. In the film, Barry travels back in time to prevent his mother's death, which brings unintended consequences.
18-6	Michael Shannon’s Zod will be a major villain in The Flash from the look of the trailers, as he returns to his role from a decade ago in Man of Steel. You can find out more about him with our General Zod explained guide. However, this is The Flash, and we know the movie will be bending multiple realities and skipping through time. YouTube Thumbnail This means, in theory, we could see returning villains from across DC movie history: we could see the likes of Jack Nicholson’s Joker and other villains to Michael Keaton’s Batman, and while Eobard Thawne as the-Reverse Flash would also make a great deal of sense within the story.
18-7	The development of a film based on The Flash began in the late 1980s, with multiple writers and directors attached to the project through 2014. The film was then redeveloped as a part of the DCEU, with Miller cast as the title character. Multiple directors were attached to the film over the following years, with Seth Grahame-Smith, Rick Famuyiwa, and the duo of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein all departing the project over creative differences. Muschietti and Hodson joined the film in July 2019, and pre-production began in January 2020. The film is influenced by the comic book storyline Flashpoint, featuring multiple DC characters, including Ben Affleck and Keaton reprising their respective versions of Batman. Principal photography took place from April to October 2021 at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden and on location around the United Kingdom.
18-8	Development on a film based on the DC character the Flash began in the late 1980s when Warner Bros. Pictures hired comic book writer Jeph Loeb to write a screenplay.[42] Warner Bros. hired David S. Goyer to write, direct, and produce a new version of The Flash in December 2004 after he impressed them with his script for Batman Begins (2005).[43][44] Goyer approached Ryan Reynolds to portray Wally West / The Flash after working with him on the Marvel Comics-based film Blade: Trinity (2004) and intended to have the character Barry Allen appear in a supporting role. Goyer was influenced for the film's tone by Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy and the Flash comic book runs by Mike Baron, Mark Waid and Geoff Johns. By early February 2007, Goyer left the project over creative differences with the studio,[44][45] and Shawn Levy was hired to direct and oversee the writing of a new draft written by Chris Brancato, which used elements from Goyer's script.[46][47] Later that month, Warner Bros. announced the development of a Justice League film, with Michelle and Kieran Mulroney writing the screenplay.[48] George Miller signed on to direct the film, titled Justice League: Mortal, in September,[49] with Adam Brody cast as the Flash.[50] It was envisioned as the start of a franchise with planned sequels and spin-offs, including the Flash film.[49]
18-9	"Warner Bros. was planning a new shared universe of films based on DC by July 2013 and had tentative plans to release a Flash film in 2016.[58] In October 2014, Warner Bros. and DC Films announced a slate of planned projects as part of the new DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The Flash was set for release on March 23, 2018,[59] with Ezra Miller set to star in the film as Barry Allen / The Flash;[8][59] Miller first made cameo appearances in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and Suicide Squad (2016),[60][61] starred in the team-up film Justice League (2017),[59] and briefly appeared in the Arrowverse crossover event ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"" (2019–20), which acknowledged a wider DC Multiverse, and in the first season of the series Peacemaker (2022–present).[22][62] Warner Bros. offered James Wan the choice of directing a movie about either Aquaman or the Flash, and he ultimately chose to make Aquaman (2018).[63] By April 2015, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were writing a story treatment for the Flash film with the possibility of directing it.[64] After they decided to direct Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) instead, Seth Grahame-Smith entered negotiations to write and direct the film based on Lord and Christopher Miller's treatment in October 2015. Grahame-Smith was set to make his directorial debut with the film, with Roven producing and Deborah and Zack Snyder executive producing.[65] In February 2016, the film's release date was moved forward to March 16, 2018.[66] Grahame-Smith left the project that April, citing creative differences. Warner Bros. chose to retain his script,[67] and he was still expected to be involved in the project moving forward, while Lord and Christopher Miller were also still involved as producers. A search for a replacement director began immediately."
18-10	"Finally after the early screening on 6th June which showed the unfinished print, I get to watch the final cut on IMAX today. One major drawback is that a movie this big has both really good and really bad VFX. Apart from that, this complete fan service aims at not taking the story forward into the DCEU's newly planned future, instead takes Barry Allen on his usual time travel to save his mom and him learning the repercussions of his action, the hard way. This harmless PG-13 movie sticks to the basics and plays safe to the core. Adds a bunch of cameos from DC universe to get us fans riled up. The narrative ranges from meh to ""oh that's fun"" and the director Andy Muschietti hardly fails in hitting the mark. He clearly knows what he intends to do with this script and plays to it's strengths. Ezra Miller indeed is good as The Flash is an added advantage and rest Michael Keaton's return as Batman takes care off. Special mention to all the cameos as they simply were that good. Needless to say, the film is worth watching for them. Sasha Calle's Supergirl has very little to do and she tries to make most of what is offered to her. The visuals during the time travel and the reveal of multiverse was well done. The humor ensures to lighten the tone while keeping the mother-son sentiment intact. Not sure what DCEU's future holds for us fans, The Flash succeeds in entertaining for most of those 2.5hrs."
18-11	The Flash has been one of the most successful shows to be brought to life in the Arrowverse. Grant Gustin sports the red tracksuit as Barry Allen and becomes the fastest man alive who patrols Central City and protects it from evil. After being struck by lightning, Barry Allen developed a meta-human power that allows him to move at super speeds, granting him a number of abilities. Seeking to use his power for the betterment of mankind, Barry decides to put on a costume and become Central City's superhero, the Flash.
18-12	I just got out of The Flash OK. So it does not live up to the positive buzz from the early screenings. It's nowhere near being one of the best comic book movies of all time. It's not even in the conversation for being one of the best DC movies. But I did have a lot of fun with it. A lot may depend on your feelings of Ezra Miller. Younger Barry Allen was really annoying, but I think that's the point. I had no issues with them in the role. The stand out for me, was Michael Keaton. When Batman is doing his things and Danny Elfman's iconic score is booming, it's a joy. But make no mistake this is not Batman 3, it's a Flash movie that features Keaton's Batman. Supergirl was good, I enjoyed her, and if she gets a stand alone, I'd watch it. There were some surprises, that I'm amazed have not leaked. It feels it's run time at times and some of the CGI is very dodgy, especially during a certain moment. Considering what they were going for, I can't believe they released it like that. The CGI at that moment is my biggest complaint. They get away with a lot with its rating including nudity and a fair amount of bad language, including the F bomb. I'm not sure if I'll watch it again, but I had a good time, watching this one time.
18-13	"MOVIE INFO Worlds collide in ""The Flash"" when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian... albeit not the one he's looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry's only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe?

18-14	This story mentions a few significant plot developments in “The Flash,” currently playing in theaters. In the climax of “The Flash,” Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) watches helplessly as his timeline-hopping escapades cause several other superhero universes to careen into each other and become obliterated in the process. Ironically, Warner Bros. is facing almost an identical dilemma — and the stakes could be nearly as existential. “The Flash” is the second of four mega-budgeted DC adaptations the studio is set to release this year, starting with “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” in March, and followed by “Blue Beetle” and “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” in August and December. Yet these movies were conceived and greenlit by an executive team that all have departed the studio; in their place, new DC Studios chiefs James Gunn and Peter Safran have announced they will reboot the DC franchise in 2025, starting with Gunn’s “Superman: Legacy.”
18-15	Ezra Miller made a public showing for the first time in nearly two years on Monday night, attending the Los Angeles premiere of DC Studios’ “The Flash.” The embattled actor spoke openly about misconduct allegations levied against them and various legal woes, addressing fans and many industry players at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Miller, who is non-binary and uses they and them pronouns, made a big show of acknowledging Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, Warner Bros. Film Group heads Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy and DC Studios stewards James Gunn and Peter Safran for “your grace and discernment and care in the context of my life. And in bringing this moment to fruition.”
18-16	With selections for Emmy nominations on the horizon and officially announced in July, one stand-out project to keep in mind is the Showtime limited series George & Tammy, about the triumphs, tragedies, and undeniable love of country music power couple George Jones (Michael Shannon) and Tammy Wynette (Jessica Chastain). The story has powerful and memorable performances from the two lead actors at its center, who show both the flawed human beings behind the superstars and the beauty of their connection through their music.
18-17	At long, long last, The Flash revealed the identity of Savitar, the masked villain who has terrorized Team Flash since Flashpoint. For a fair portion of this season, fans have been disappointed with how The Flash has handled that Flashpoint storyline and the reveal (or lack thereof) regarding Savitar. For one, Flashpoint lasted one solitary episode in a season that has 22 hours to burn. After that the show settled, briefly, into a pattern that helped define Season 1’s fun: villains of the week, created by Alchemy as a way to kind of punish Barry by restoring their Flashpoint powers.
18-18	But even that was dragged down but a really dour Cisco and a team that felt very broken, especially after the fairly early reveal that Alchemy could be a friend (Julien) who was blindly controlled by the ultimate foe: Savitar. The faceless “god of speed” didn’t seem like a masked villain at first — he just seemed like an agent of evil, but not a particularly scary one (he’s no Zoom!) Barry then sees him killing Iris in the future, something he can’t seem to stop, yet even that didn’t raise the stakes. We know Iris isn’t going to die, so getting stuck on that scene and going through Team Flash’s flailing for months of episodes became very tedious, very fast. Once Barry tried to suddenly pull Savitar’s head off, it because clear that he wasn’t just a Speed Force Decepticon, he was another masked villain. Of course!
18-19	Michael Reventar is ready to unleash what may be The Flash‘s most frightening villain: Blackout. The character makes his debut Tuesday when he targets Dr. Wells (Tom Cavanagh) for the death of his friend (Jacky Lai), whom we meet briefly in the episode and who was killed the same night Barry (Grant Gustin) got his powers. What makes his villain a little different is you get to see him as a happy young man before the accident that gave him his powers. “You don’t just meet the monster, you meet the man as well,” Reventar tells The Holllywood Reporter.

It was first awarded in 2000 as one of the seven constituent awards presented during the Laureus World Sports Awards.[1] The awards are presented by the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, a global organisation involved in more than 150 charity projects supporting 500,000 young people.[3] The first ceremony was held on 25 May 2000 in Monte Carlo, at which Nelson Mandela gave the keynote speech.[4] As of 2020, a shortlist of six nominees for the award comes from a panel composed of the ""world's leading sports editors, writers and broadcasters"".[1] The Laureus World Sports Academy then selects the winner who is presented with a Laureus statuette, created by Cartier, at the annual awards ceremony held in various locations around the world.[5] The awards are considered highly prestigious and are frequently referred to as the sporting equivalent of ""Oscars"".[6][7][8] The inaugural winner of the award was the American golfer Tiger Woods who finished the 1999 season with eight wins, a feat not achieved since 1974, including the PGA Championship.[9][10] He went on to become the most dominant player of his era,[11] earning a second Laureus Award the following year, and five further nominations between 2002 and 2008. The 2003 winner of the Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year was the American road cyclist Lance Armstrong. He had been nominated the previous year, and earned further nominations in 2004, 2005 and 2006. Following Armstrong's 2013 admission of doping,[12] all his Laureus awards and nominations were rescinded.[13] Tennis players dominate the winners list, with eleven awards, while athletes and Formula One drivers have won four times, and golfers twice. Excluding Armstrong, the Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year has been won by just nine individuals since its inception.

19-14	Lionel Messi has been named sportsman of the year at the Laureus World Sports Awards. Messi, who finally realised his World Cup dream in Qatar, also accepted the team of the year award on behalf of Argentina, who beat France on penalties in last year’s epic final. The 35-year-old accepted the accolades at a ceremony in Paris just hours after it was confirmed that he had returned to Paris Saint-Germain following a club suspension.
19-15	The accomplishments keep adding up for Lionel Messi and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce. Both were awarded Laureus World Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year awards, respectively, Monday (8 May) during a ceremony in Paris. Messi captivated the globe in 2022, finally capturing the one accolade lacking in his historic career: a win for Argentina at the FIFA World Cup. The 35-year-old was instrumental in his team clinching the title, scoring seven goals including two in the final against France. Argentina also won the Laureus World Team of the Year Award for its World Cup title win. Messi is the first person to win both the Sportsman and Team of the Year awards in the same year. Fraser-Pryce, who beat out fellow Olympic champions Mikael Shiffrin, Katie Ledecky and Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone for the award, underlined her credentials as one of the greatest track and field athletes of all time in 2022 when she won her fifth career World Championship gold medal in the women's 100 metres sprint in Eugene.

20-0	During an opening weekend that was more dramatic than most movies, Disney’s The Little Mermaid ended up grossing $163.8 million worldwide, falling short of projections by around $20 million. Most of the discrepancy could be attributed to a soft global opening, which came in at around $68 million. But a couple of days after it was expected to, the big-budget live-action remake of the classic 1989 animated film has finally passed the $200 million mark at the worldwide box office. The Little Mermaid has made $130 million domestically and another $79 million from overseas territories, for a running global haul of $209 million. The movie cost a reported $250 million to produce (minus marketing), which means that there is an ocean currently separating it from success. The Little Mermaid grossed $38 million domestically on opening day, setting it up for a four-day extended weekend haul of $125 million. But it ultimately ended up making $117 million across four days at the domestic box office. Globally, the movie was expected to hit $80 million in its opening weekend, but it fell short of this figure by around $12 million
20-1	The Little Mermaid, the live-action remake of the classic 1989 Disney animated film of the same name, has become so shrouded in debate and politicization that simply liking the film, or not liking the film, has become less about holding a critical opinion and more about defending an ideological position and making a statement. While many people honestly felt that the very idea of remaking the beloved 1989 film was pointless, if not sacrilegious, much of the criticism of the remake has, of course, centered on the remake’s perceived woke agenda, specifically with the casting of Halle Bailey, a black actress, as the film’s titular character, in a traditionally red-haired, and white, role.
20-2	Released in North America on May 26, 2023, prior to the Memorial Day Weekend, The Little Mermaid grossed $118.6 million over the Friday-to-Monday Memorial Day frame, slightly ahead of the 2019 live-action remake of Aladdin, which grossed $116.8 million during the same four-day frame in 2019. However, this $118.6 million opening weekend at the domestic box office was more than offset by a lackluster opening weekend performance in the international markets, where The Little Mermaid only grossed $63.8 million, including a pitiful $2.5 million opening weekend gross from the all-important Chinese market.
20-3	Family audiences turned out in force, propelling Disney’s “The Little Mermaid” to the top of the box office over the Memorial Day weekend. The film, a live-action remake of the 1988 animated favorite, earned a splashy $117.5 million over the four-day holiday. It ranks as the fifth largest Memorial Day debut — last year’s “Top Gun: Maverick” set a new record for the holiday with its $160.5 million launch. At one point over the weekend, it looked as if “The Little Mermaid” might even open north of $120 million, but ticket sales flagged slightly. For Disney, the film’s popularity is a testament to its strategy of digging deep into its vaults and rebooting animated titles as live action movies, something it has done successfully with the likes of “Aladdin,” “Beauty and the Beast” and “The Lion King.” Waiting out on the horizon: Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson, the Oscar-winning director of “Summer of Soul,” is helming a remake of “The Aristocats” for Disney.
20-4	The Little Mermaid is a 2023 American musical fantasy film directed by Rob Marshall from a screenplay written by David Magee. Co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures, Lucamar Productions, and Marc Platt Productions, it is a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1989 animated film of the same name, itself loosely based on the 1837 fairy tale of the same title by Hans Christian Andersen. The film stars Halle Bailey in the titular role, alongside Jonah Hauer-King, Daveed Diggs, Awkwafina, Jacob Tremblay, Noma Dumezweni, Art Malik, Javier Bardem and Melissa McCarthy. The Little Mermaid follows a mermaid princess Ariel who is fascinated with the human world and makes a deal with a treacherous sea witch Ursula to trade her voice for human legs in order to impress Prince Eric, who she saved from a shipwreck before time runs out.
20-5	Plans for a remake of 1989's The Little Mermaid were confirmed in May 2016. In December 2017, Disney announced Marshall was being courted to direct the film. Bailey, Hauer-King, McCarthy, Bardem, Diggs, Tremblay, Awkwafina, and the rest of the cast signed on between July to November 2019. Production was expected to begin in London between late March and early April 2020 but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming ultimately took place primarily at Pinewood Studios in England and on the island of Sardinia, Italy, from January to July 2021. Composer Alan Menken, who worked on the original film's soundtrack, returned to compose the score and write new songs alongside Lin-Manuel Miranda, who serves as a producer with Platt, John DeLuca and Marshall. The film is dedicated to the late Howard Ashman, who co-produced and co-wrote the songs from the original film.
20-6	"`""The Little Mermaid"" (Danish: Den lille havfrue) is a literary fairy tale written by the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, first published in 1837 as part of a collection of fairy tales for children. The story follows the journey of a young mermaid who is willing to give up her life in the sea as a mermaid to gain a human soul. The original story has been the subject of multiple analyses by scholars such as Jacob Bøggild and Pernille Heegaard, as well as the folklorist Maria Tatar. These analyses cover various aspects of the story, from interpreting the themes to discussing why Andersen chose to write a tragic story with a happy ending. It has been adapted to various media, including musical theatre, anime, ballet, opera, and film. There is also a statue portraying the mermaid in Copenhagen, Denmark, where the story was written and first published."
20-7	`“The Little Mermaid” is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton’s daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy.
20-8	As it nears the end of its theatrical run, Disney’s The Little Mermaid is indicating that it might have the energy for one last lap. The movie has struggled commercially after debuting a little over three weeks ago, but after braving some choppy waters initially, it appears to have steadied itself. This weekend The Little Mermaid swam past three new milestones at the box office — the $250 million mark domestically, the $200 million mark in international territories, and the $450 million mark worldwide. Not too long ago, these numbers might have sounded far-fetched. But as things stand, The Little Mermaid now has a strong chance of finishing with half a billion dollars worldwide before running out of breath. Currently, the movie has made $253 million at the domestic box office, and $212 million from overseas territories, for a global haul of $465 million. As you can probably tell from these numbers, The Little Mermaid’s revenue has been unusually skewed. Films of this size — big-budget, effects-driven spectacles — tend to generate more money from overseas markets, but it seems like the brand isn’t as beloved internationally as it is at home. The Little Mermaid debuted with $117 million in its extended domestic opening weekend, and generated $168 million worldwide globally in its debut. These are hardly splashy numbers, especially considering the film’s massive $250 million reported production budget (which, as usual, doesn’t include the marketing spends). As a rule of thumb, movies this size need to make twice their budgets theatrically to break even, and the fact that Disney was willing to spend so heavily on The Little Mermaid shows that the studio had high hopes from the movie.
20-9	The Little Mermaid may have just destroyed a $1 billion box office trend, causing many to wonder if Disney's live-action remakes will ever be able to recover. 2023's The Little Mermaid remake was supposed to be one of the biggest Disney movies of the year, with the film getting an immense amount of marketing and hype. However, the film has seemingly fallen flat, with The Little Mermaid not living up to many of Disney's other live-action remakes. Because of this, it could be possible that The Little Mermaid could be the final nail in the coffin of the trend of success for Disney's remakes.
20-10	"The live-action movie 'The Little Mermaid' continues to generate controversy even though it remains a hit at the box office. First there was the issue of casting an actress of color in the role of Ariel, the mermaid protagonist who in the 1998 cartoon was white-skinned and red-haired. Now another controversy has arisen with actor Stefano Tomadini, who plays one of the tritons in 'The Little Mermaid'. It has come to light that this performer has a past in adult films, where his name was Dante Ferrari. The 24-year-old actor managed to catch the attention of casting bosses, who were looking for ""really sexy male models"" and didn't hesitate to take Tomadini."
20-11	The Little Mermaid is getting doused in select foreign markets amid a racist backlash over the casting of Black actress Halle Bailey in the role of Ariel. The movie has grossed a mere $3.6 million in its first 10 days of release in China, by far the worst showing among Disney’s live-action adaptations. It is also struggling badly in South Korea, where it has earned $4.4 million through June 4. Sources close to the movie, as well as box office analysts, say Disney knew Little Mermaid could face challenges, but is surprised by the extent of the backlash and its impact.
20-12	In what looks like one of the biggest announcements at this year’s Annecy Animation Festival, Disney Branded Television has greenlit a new animated series for preschoolers, “Disney Junior’s Ariel,” inspired by the hugely popular story of “The Little Mermaid.” The announcement is set to be made today by Ayo Davis, president of Disney Branded Television, during the Annecy Animation Festival, at a new project and sneak peak picked presentation across the upcoming slate of Disney Branded Television and Disney EMEA titles.

20-14	For the past several years, Disney has been remaking some of its more recent animated classics as live-action, effects-laden extravaganzas — among them Beauty and the Beast (2017) and The Lion King (2019). Now, the Mouse House has turned its attention to The Little Mermaid, which in 1989 was hailed as an instant classic that ranked with its greatest accomplishments. By and large, the remakes have been enjoyable, but none have been superior to the original. The pattern repeats itself with The Little Mermaid. It’s no classic, but it does have enough charm and style to recommend it. It also provides a spectacular showcase for leading lady Halle Bailey, who plays the title role of the adventurous mermaid Ariel. Bailey has sass, sparkle, and — dare it be said? — sex appeal. She’s expressive, ethereal, and sings like an angel. Folks, a star is born.
20-15	WHAT IS DRIVING THE INTEREST IN WATER-RELATED PRODUCTS? It’s been just about a month since the live-action version of “The Little Mermaid” opened in theaters, and the film is still making ripples. However, it’s not just “Little Mermaid” merchandise, such as toys and dolls, that are selling out; search queries for “swimming pool near me” have increased by 196% since the film was released. Is it just Disney’s new movie or is something else spiking interest?
20-16	The Little Mermaid: A Splashy Success in the Philippines Disney’s live-action remake of its 1989 animated classic, The Little Mermaid, has been a hit in the Philippines, becoming the biggest blockbuster of the year in the Southeast Asian country. The film has earned $5.8 million and surpassed Hollywood’s two biggest global hits of the year, Universal’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie ($2.2 million) and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 ($4.7 million). John Hsu, Disney’s svp of studio business in Asia Pacific, says, “The Philippines, obviously, is a standout market for us. It’s rare, but it’s the biggest territory for The Little Mermaid in Southeast Asia by far, our third highest-grossing market in Asia-Pacific behind Australia and Japan, and our 11th highest-grossing territory globally.”
20-17	Halle Bailey and the rest of the cast of “The Little Mermaid” took the theaters by storm in the creation of an awesome live-action remake of the 1989 Disney classic. Featuring new songs written and composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Alan Menken, as well as some awesome acting from Daveed Diggs as Sebastian, and Melissa McCarthy as Ursula, this movie brought everything the fans desired from the original movie but never got. “The Little Mermaid” is an unforgettable story about a young mermaid named Ariel who wishes to live a life above the water, where the humans resided. Through hardships and conflicts, Ariel is given the opportunity to live amongst the humans when encountered by Ursula, the Sea Witch. After falling into her trap, Ariel is doomed to become one of Ursula’s pets, but with a little help from Ariel’s friends Scuttle, Flounder, and Sebastian, we see Ariel break away from evil and by the end of the story, she falls in love with Prince Eric and live happily ever after.
20-18	With music by Alan Menken, lyrics by Howard Ashman & Glenn Slater, and book by Doug Wright, the stage musical is based on the original 1989 Disney movie, which was taken from the Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale of the same name. It's a common tale of a typical teenager ready to explore a world beyond her boundaries, and a father who isn't ready to give up his little girl. This take of the theme involves Ariel (Amaya Hardin), the little mermaid, who likes to hang out above the ocean, and falls in love with a handsome human prince (Tyler Mann), that she rescued when he fell overboard. In true musical fashion, she sings to him, he falls in love with her voice, and then she swims away before he can find out that he was just rescued by a mermaid. Due to family strife with her father King Triton (Nick Farr), Ariel enlists Aunt Ursula (Julie Atkins) to turn her human. For payment, Ariel has to give up her voice and has her soul as collateral.
20-19	First released as an animated film in 1989, the story of the free-spirited Ariel has been a classic for decades. Thirty-four years later, its live action re-release is capturing a new generation with a bright and vibrant retelling of the mermaid’s aquatic adventures. The remake of the Disney classic follows Ariel, (Halle Bailey) a young mermaid who falls in love with the reigning prince of the nearby human town after rescuing him from a shipwreck. Tailed by her sea creature friends Flounder (Jacob Tremblay) and Sebastian (Daveed Diggs), Ariel makes a deal with Ursula (Melissa McCarthy), a sea witch, to exchange her voice for legs in an effort to see Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King) again. Despite the best confounding efforts of many, Ariel eventually finds her happy ever after with the prince. Bailey gave a radiant performance as the bubbly protagonist. While it can often be difficult to adapt an animated character, Bailey’s portrayal perfectly captured the young mermaid’s curiosity and passion that shone through in the original animation, creating a unique version of the beloved character. Fans of the 1989 rendition will be happy to hear that the live-action remake rarely departed from the original’s plotlines and character arcs, electing to stay true to the contours and classic music numbers (with a few original songs included).
